Description of Major Computational biology is a new and promising field of study. The purpose of this interdisciplinary major is to provide a top-notch educational program for students interested in the areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. The program seeks to achieve two goals: 1) to develop an understanding of the issues associated with developing biologically meaningful computational models, and 2) to give students the broad-based education that is needed to create a set of models directed towards solving a practical biomedical problem. This major is offered through the Computer Science departments. The Biological Science department has a separate Computational Biology degree with different degree requirements. Please see the Biological Science department for degree requirements. Prerequisite Coursework: BSC X010 (3,) General Biology I or equivalent BSC X011 (3) General Biology I or equivalent CHM X045, X045L (3, 1) General Chemistry I & Lab or equivalent CHM X046, X046L (3, 1) General Chemistry II & Lab PHY X053, X053L (4) or PHY X048, X048L (4) College or General Physics A with lab MAC X311 (4) Calculus I MAC X312 (4) Calculus II Interested students are encouraged to contact the participating departments regarding completion of these courses. Strongly recommended: Students interested in this major are encouraged to complete an introductory programming course in C++ or equivalent during their freshman/sophomore years. Note: State-wide common prerequisites are always under review. For the most current information and for acceptable alternative courses, visit the \u201cCommon Prerequisites Manual.\u201d This is available from the \u201cStudent Services\u201d section of http://www.flvc.org . Requirements for graduation in the College of Arts and Sciences include : The College of Arts and Science requires proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate (2220 or equivalent) level or sign language through the advanced (2614 or equivalent) level. Requirements for Progression to the Upper-Division Major Students must complete at least 52 semester hours of credit with a minimum grade point average of 2.0, at least half the required Liberal Studies hours including English and mathematics, or an A.A. Degree. Mapping Mapping is FSU\u2019s academic advising and monitoring system. Academic progress is monitored each Fall and Spring semester to ensure that students are on course to earn their degree in a timely fashion. Transfer students must meet mapping guidelines to be accepted into their majors. View the map for this major at www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/ .
