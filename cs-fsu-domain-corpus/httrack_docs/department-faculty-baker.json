He believes in the importance of formal and experimental methods, and in the transition of computer science research to engineering standards. He served as domain expert for real-time and systems programming in the ANSI/ISO Ada 95 language standard revision project, and directed the FSU team that developed the real-time multitasking runtime system for the Gnu Ada 95 compiler (GNAT). His current research focus is on real-time multiprocessor scheduling, including the both analytical study of schedulability and the empirical study of performance of working real-time multiprocessor kernels."}
