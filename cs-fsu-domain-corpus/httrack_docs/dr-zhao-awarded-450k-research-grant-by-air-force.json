Peixiang is one of 45 scientists and engineers to share some $19.9 million in grants from this year\u2019s AFOSR YIP program. The program is open to researchers in the U.S. who have received a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in the last five years and demonstrate \u201cexceptional ability and promise for conducting basic research.\u201d Peixiang\u2019s proposal was titled \u201cGraphs at Your Fingertips: Managing and Summarizing Big Graphs.\u201d In this project, Peixiang will work with his students to design and develop scalable graph management and summarization solutions that can simplify real-world graphs of extreme scale, heterogeneity, and dynamics into concise, structure-enriched, and quality-preserving summaries with the goal of enabling efficient, cost-effective, scalable, and interactive management and computation for big graphs."}
