End user submits a shopping cart to Edwina (the requester) AND a purchasing request form (found on the CS website. This form was formerly called the GREETS form, but has since been renamed the Purchasing Requisition (GREETS) Form under resources on the CS website. The purchasing request form must be submitted, in addition to the shopping cart, as the request form contains the budget information required for budget managers to verify available funds, as such, before a requisition can be processed. 2. Once the cart is assigned to Edwina, she receives an email stating that a shopping cart has been submitted. At that point, she print the PRF to enter budget information and locate the shopping cart for that order for approval routing through the OMNI requisition system for order processing. 3. Purchasing receives the order, processes the purchase order and submits the purchase order to the selected vendor for ordering. 4. Vendor receives the order and processes it for shipping."}
