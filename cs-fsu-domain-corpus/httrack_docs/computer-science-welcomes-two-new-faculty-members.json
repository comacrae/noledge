He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from UC Davis\u00a0in 2013. Prior to joining FSU, Dr. Hoang held post-doc positions at\u00a0UC San Diego, University of Maryland, and UC Santa Barbara. Dr. \u00a0Hoang\u2019s\u00a0research area is cryptography, with a practice-oriented theme.\u00a0His line of research aims to bridge the gap between the theory and\u00a0practice of cryptography, giving products of genuine utility that are\u00a0theoretically justified yet faster than heuristic solutions. For\u00a0example, he has built a new authenticated encryption scheme AEZ to\u00a0improve both security and speed of standardized schemes underlying\u00a0Internet protocols such as HTTPS, IPSec, and WPA2. AEZ is currently a\u00a0second-round candidate in the standardization competition CAESAR.\u00a0Dr. Hoang\u2019s research papers earned the Best Honorable Mention at EUROCRYPT\u00a02015 and Best Paper Award at CCS 2015. Dr. Adrian Nistor joins the department this fall semester as an assistant\u00a0professor. Dr. Nistor received his PhD from the Department of Computer Science\u00a0at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in May 2014.\u00a0Prior to joining FSU, Dr. Nistor has been with the Computer Science Department\u00a0at Chapman University as an assistant professor.\u00a0Adrian\u2019s research interests are in software\u00a0engineering, with a focus on detecting, repairing, and preventing bugs in\u00a0real-world applications. His current research projects investigate performance,\u00a0concurrency, and mobile bugs. His techniques found more than 190\u00a0previously unknown bugs in widely used software, e.g., Google Chrome,\u00a0Mozilla, Google Core Libraries, GCC, MySQL, Ant, Lucene, Groovy,\u00a0Tomcat, JUnit, JMeter, Log4J, Struts, etc. More than 140 of these\u00a0bugs have already been fixed by developers based on Adrian\u2019s and his\u00a0collaborators\u2019 reports. Adrian\u2019s research includes empirical and analytical work, static and dynamic techniques, and bugs from various application types\u2014client, server, mobile, and scientific applications. Dr. Nistor won an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper award at ICSE 2015. He received an NSF grant as a sole PI to investigate performance bugs that have non-intrusive fixes. He is a committer to Apache Collections. He published in ICSE, MICRO, ISSTA, MSR, and JDPC. Adrian collaborated with three PhD students, three master\u2019s students, and seven undergraduate students. He is looking for highly motivated students to do research with at Florida State University!"}
