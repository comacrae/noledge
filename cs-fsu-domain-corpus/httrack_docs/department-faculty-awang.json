Because the systems field constantly sprouts new research domains with independent evolutions, it is crucial to develop solutions that resolve incompatible assumptions and requirements among multiple domains. His recent work, the Conquest file system, illustrates how performance improvement does not preclude system simplicity. His continuing work, Conquest-2, aims to conserve energy while improving performance at the same time. Andy is also the inventor of electric-field-based multipath routing for mobile ad hoc networks, which demonstrates how large-scale distributed coordination can be achieved without communication and maintaining states. Previously, Wang was involved in analyzing the performance of optimistic peer replication through his parallel simulation framework."}
