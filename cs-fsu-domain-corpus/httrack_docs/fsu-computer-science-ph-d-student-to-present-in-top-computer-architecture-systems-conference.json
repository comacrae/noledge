Khandaker, a Ph.D. candidate in the CS Department under the supervision of Prof. Zhi Wang, has published a full paper in the prestigious 25th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS\u201920), which will hold on March 16-20, 2020 in Lausanne, Switzerland. ASPLOS is one of the top-tier conferences in the computer architecture and systems area. The paper, titled \u201cCOIN Attacks: On Insecurity of Enclave Untrusted Interfaces in SGX,\u201d proposes a comprehensive threat model, named \u201cCOIN Attacks\u201d in the Intel SGX enclave interface and develops an extensible framework to detect enclave vulnerabilities in the presence of the COIN attacks. The research reports 52 vulnerabilities in 10 GitHub open-source SGX projects. The artifact earns two badges \u201cArtifact Available\u201d and \u201cArtifact Functional\u201d from ASPLOS AE reviewers. In addition, Mustakimur published two papers earlier in Control-flow Integrity (CFI): \u201cAdaptive Call-site Sensitive Control Flow Integrity\u201d won the Best Paper Award in EuroS&P, and \u201cOrigin-sensitive Control Flow Integrity\u201d was published in USENIX Security, a top Computer Security conference. All three projects are available at the author\u2019s GitHub page: https://github.com/mustakcsecuet/ . Mustakimur is currently\u00a0seeking a job in academics."}
