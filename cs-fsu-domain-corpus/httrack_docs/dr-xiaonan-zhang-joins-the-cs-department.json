She received her Ph.D. from Clemson University in Aug. 2020, and she received her M.S. degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton in 2017. Her current research interests focus on intelligent next-generation network systems, with an emphasis on resource allocation, network science, and wireless security in a heterogeneous wireless environment. She is looking for highly motivated students to work with at FSU. Note: next-generation network systems are expected to connect billions of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices along with billions of people, enable machine-to-machine communications, and provide low-latency computational and storage resources on-demand at the edge and in the cloud."}
