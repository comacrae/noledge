International applicants whose native language is not English must submit official TOEFL results in order to be admitted to the Computer Science graduate program. Students with a 4-year Bachelor\u2019s or a graduate degree from an accredited university in an English-speaking country can be exempt from the TOEFL for admissions purposes.
