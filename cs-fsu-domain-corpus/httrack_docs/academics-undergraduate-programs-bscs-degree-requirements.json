Description of Major This major provides a broad-based background sufficient for entry to a career in computing. It provides a systems view of computing, emphasizing the interdependence of design, object orientation, and distributed systems and networks, from basic software through systems design. This major develops core competencies in programming, database structure, computer organization, and operating systems. It allows opportunities to study a range of other aspects of computer and information science, such as information security, data communication/ networks, computer and network systems administration, theoretical computer science, and software engineering. Every student can expect to become proficient at programming in C , C++, and Assembly Language. Additionally, students will be exposed to other languages such as Java, C#, Ada, Lisp, Scheme, Prolog, Perl, and HTML. This major is available on campus or through Distance Learning. The coursework required for this major includes an embedded collateral minor in mathematics and physical sciences. It is ABET/CAC accredited and is intended to be sufficient for entry to a graduate program in computer science. Internet Supported Distance Learning The programs available through internet-supported distance learning are degree programs that enable students with an Associate in Arts (A.A.) degree from a Florida public institution to earn an FSU bachelor\u2019s degree without moving to Tallahassee. The programs are designed for part time study. Each student receives access to a course Web site and the e-mail addresses of everyone associated with the class. A unique feature of the distance learning programs is the support FSU provides through an assigned Mentor. Mentors serve as learning guides, helping to facilitate each individual student\u2019s success. Students interact with each other, their Mentors, and their instructors via e-mail, Web-based discussion pages, and telephone calls. Students interested in Distance Learning should contact the Office of Distance Learning (ODL). For more information contact (877) FLSTATE or visit the web at https://distance.fsu.edu . Prerequisite Coursework: BS program in Computer Science The following must be completed with a grade of C- or higher. These courses may be taken as part of Liberal Studies or as general electives. COP XXXX (3) Introductory Programming in C, C++, JAVA or equivalent language (C++ preferred) XXX XXXX (2-4) One science course for science majors (contact department for a list of acceptable courses) MAC X311 (4) Calculus I MAC X312 (4) Calculus II One of the following series PHY X048C (4-5) General Physics A and PHY X049C (4-5) General Physics A and B or equivalent with lab, or * BSC X010 (3) and BSC X011(3) and CHM X045C (4) * Students selecting this option may satisfy the \u201cOne science course\u201d requirement by completing BSC X010L and BSC X011L. Note: State-wide common prerequisites are always under review. For the most current information and for acceptable alternative courses, visit the \u201cCommon Prerequisites Manual.\u201d This is available from the \u201cStudent Services\u201d section of http://www.flvc.org . Requirements for graduation in the College of Arts and Sciences include : The College of Arts and Science requires proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate (2220 or equivalent) level or sign language through the advanced (2614 or equivalent) level. Foreign language courses are not available via distance learning. Admissions/Continuation Requirements to the Major Program of Studies : Students should complete the prerequisite coursework with the grade of \u201cC-\u201d or higher in to be considered for entrance to the major program of study. Students must also have completed a minimum of 52 hours of credit and at least half the required hours in Liberal Studies including required English and Math, or an A.A degree. Distance Learning students must complete the A.A. from a Florida public institution, required prerequisites, and a Supplemental Admissions Application prior to admission. Distance Learning students should also complete the oral competency requirement and the College of Arts and Sciences foreign language requirement prior to admissions. In accordance with the University residency rule, degree requirements not available online must be completed prior to the final 30 hours of the degree. The Computer Science major is limited access. The minimum GPA for acceptance is 2.65 and students in the program must maintain a 2.5 GPA. A student who has accumulated more than 5 grades below a C- (including grades of U) in Mathematics, Statistics, natural science or computer science courses taken for college credit at FSU or elsewhere, whether reated or not, will not be permitted to continue as a major in the department. Mapping Mapping is FSU\u2019s academic advising and monitoring system. Academic progress is monitored each Fall and Spring semester to ensure that students are on course to earn their degree in a timely fashion. Transfer students must meet mapping guidelines to be accepted into their majors. You may view the map for this major at www.academic-guide.fsu.edu .
