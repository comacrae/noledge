His recent work on wireless sensing has been published in a paper, titled \u201cWiFinger: Leveraging Commodity WiFi for Fine-grained Finger Gesture Recognition\u201d and co-authored with Prof. Jie Yang in ACM Mobihoc 2016, a top tier conference in the Mobile and Wireless Computing area. In the paper, Sheng proposed a finger gesture recognition system by using a single commodity WiFi device without requiring user to wear any sensors. The proposed system is easily deployable on existing WiFi devices without using any dedicated or specialized hardware. \u00a0Experimental evaluation in both home and office environments demonstrates that WiFinger can achieve over 93% recognition accuracy and is robust to both environment changes and individual diversity. Results also show that it can work with WiFi beacon signals and provides accurate gesture recognition under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios."}
