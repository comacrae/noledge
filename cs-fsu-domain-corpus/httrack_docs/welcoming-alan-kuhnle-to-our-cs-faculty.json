Prior to joining FSU, Alan Kuhnle was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Florida Informatics Institute, where he worked on efficient algorithms for large-scale genomics indexing. He received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from University of Florida in 2018, and he received his M.S. degree in mathematics from University of Florida in 2013. His research interests include optimization, machine learning, and network science. He is interested in the design of scalable algorithms with provable performance guarantees and the application of these algorithms to problems such as misinformation containment in online social networks, image summarization, and indexing of genetic data. His works have appeared in premier conferences and journals in machine learning and data mining. He is looking for highly motivated students to work with at Florida State University."}
