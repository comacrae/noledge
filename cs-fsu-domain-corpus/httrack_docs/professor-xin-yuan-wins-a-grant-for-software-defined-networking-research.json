The project is titled \u201cSoftware Defined Networking for HPC Interconnects and its Extension across Domains.\u201d SDN is an emerging networking technology that allows software innovation in network control. It has been widely deployed in campus networks and data centers. This project will investigate the techniques and benefits of introducing Openflow-style SDN capability in the high performance computing (HPC) environment. The researchers also plan to develop software systems to provide Openflow-style SDN capability in InfiniBand, the current dominating interconnection network technology for HPC clusters, and to support SDN capability across multiple SDN domains by leveraging an existing inter-domain SDN framework such as the OSCARS system on ESnet."}
