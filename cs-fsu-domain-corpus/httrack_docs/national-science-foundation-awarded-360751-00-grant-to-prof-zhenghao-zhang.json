The project is titled \u201cNeTS: Small: Theory and Applications of Sparse Approximations of the Channel State Information in Wi-Fi Networks.\u201d The focus of this project is to design efficient methods for measuring, compressing, and utilizing the Channel State Information (CSI) of Wi-Fi networks based on the discovery made by Prof. Zhang and his student Avishek Mukherjee that the CSI can be approximated very well by very few sinusoids in most Wi-Fi networks. As the CSI is the key to many operations, such as data modulation in MU-MIMO transmissions, this project will likely remove a major bottleneck in Wi-Fi networks and allow users to enjoy higher speed and better service."}
