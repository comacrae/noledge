We have recently established an official alumni group on LinkedIn to provide a more convenient way for you to keep in touch with former classmates. Also, we hope that current students will also take advantage of the LinkedIn group as a resource to aid in their career decisions. While we have established the new LinkedIn group, we are currently still supporting the alumni registry (see in formation on the registry below).
