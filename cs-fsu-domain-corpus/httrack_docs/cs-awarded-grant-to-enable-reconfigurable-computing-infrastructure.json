With this award, Computer Science Professors Weikuan Yu, Xin Yuan, and David Whalley will acquire and develop a software-defined reconfigurable infrastructure called NoleLand. The infrastructure will feature cutting-edge manycore processors, software-defined networking, and 3D Xpoint High Bandwidth Memory devices for computer systems research. It will also test cross-layer research on performance, scalability, and resilience of large-scale systems, and develop software-defined file and storage systems for computing and data analytics applications. Furthermore, NoleLand will enable compiler and architecture co-design, and cache/memory concert for massive parallelism in GPU, software-defined networking, and HPC cluster-wide data security."}
