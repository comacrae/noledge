The NSF is the only federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering. NSF is no stranger to the department when it comes to funding research endeavors, and this designation comes with a funding package of $499,672 for the next 5 years. Professor Wang has been with the department since 2012, joining as an assistant professor where he also earned the First Year Professor Award. He earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from North Carolina State University before deciding coming to Florida State. Before that, he spent several years as a Senior Software engineer for Intel Asia-Pacific Research and Development, Ltd. His current research focuses on solving a serious issue involving trustworthy operating systems. Professor Wang seeks to develop a kernel-level security enclave for operating systems, and then use these isolated enclaves to design unique defense techniques against attacks. Also, this research could present avenues to prevent cold-boot attacks, which are security headaches for governments and corporations. Professor Wang’s work demonstrates the high level of the research our department is capable of producing and applying to real-world uses. Congratulations to Professor Wang on receiving this funding award, and best of luck on his current research."
