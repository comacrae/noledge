The list assumes courses in basic programming skills. Please see the web pages for the MS CC or MS CNSA degrees for the undergraduate prerequisites required for these degrees. Each newly admitted student must meet with the Director of Graduate Studies to complete a form indicating if any of the following must be taken. The form will be maintained in the student’s file and checked during the departmental graduation check. Also note that if a student has a BS in CS from another institution (not FSU) there may be one or more courses that we require that were not required at the student’s institution. These courses must be taken prior to graduation. The courses in the list below are prerequisites to one or more of our graduate courses.
