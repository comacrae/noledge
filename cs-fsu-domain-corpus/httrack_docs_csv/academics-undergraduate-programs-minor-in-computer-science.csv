Unless following one of the two tracks listed below , the student should obtain written approval in advance from the department for the specific combination of courses used for the minor. Students must also satisfy stated prerequisites before enrolling in any computer science course. A grade of “C-” or better must be earned in each course counted toward the minor. What is a Minor? A minor in another subject is part of the requirements for a bachelor’s degree in certain departments. Unlike a major, a student does not need to be formally admitted to a minor, nor does the minor appear on the transcript. The Department and the Registrar do not have any forms to fill out or any way to register that a student intends to complete a minor in a particular subject. A student who has fulfilled the requirements for any given minor simply claims the minor when requesting a Graduation Check with their respective College. Documentation It is up to the student’s major Department or College if they require the student to complete a minor, to verify that the student has completed an acceptable minor. This can be checked using the lists below. Because the content of this web page may change in the future, it would be a good idea for a student to print out a copy of this web page at the point the student decides to do a minor, and save the copy for later verification of the minor. Approved Tracks The following SCIENCE TRACK is a rigorous set of courses (essentially the beginning of a computer science major) that is approved and recommended for the minor: Course Prerequisites COP 3014 (3) or COP 3363 (3)* MAC 1140 COP 3353 (1) or COP 3363 (3)* none COP 3330 (3) COP 3353 (co/prerequisite) and COP 3014 Plus two of the following: CDA 3100 (3) COP 3330 (co/pre) and MAD 2104 (co/pre) CEN 4020 (3) COP 4530 (co/pre) CIS 4360 (3) COP 3330 CNT 4603 (3) CGS 3406 or COP 3014 COP 3252 (3) COP 3330 COP 4342 (3) COP 3330 COP 4530 (3) COP 3330 and MAD 2104 and CDA 3100 (co/pre) COP 4710 (3) COP 3330 and MAD 2104 COP 4610 (3) COP 4530, CDA 3100 *COP 3363 combines COP 3014 and COP 3353; students may satisfy both requirements with this course. Students may not take both COP 3014 and COP 3363 and have them both count for the minor. The following GENERAL TRACK is also approved for the minor (this is the recommended track for Information and Management Sciences majors): Course Prerequisites Any beginning programming course from the following: Java: CGS 3416 (3) MAC 1105 C++: CGS 3406 (3) or COP 3014 (3) or COP 3363 (3) MAC 1105 (CGS 3406), MAC 1140 (COP 3014, COP 3363) Python: CGS 3465 (3) MAC 1105 Plus three of the following: A second beginning programming course listed above that is not in the same programming language. CGS 2060 (3) or CGS 2100 (3) [Credit will not be given for both courses] CGS 3066 (3) None COP 3502 (3) MAC 1105 CIS 4403 (3) or CGS 2930 (3)* [Any 3-hr course listed for Science Track minor in the previous table] None *COP 3363 combines COP 3014 and COP 3353. **Students may take either CIS 4360 OR CGS 2930 towards the General Track minor in Computer Science. Other sets of courses may be recommended for students in certain specific majors. As this department works out such recommendations they will be added to this web page. Advisors in other departments are encouraged to contact the CS department chair about this."
