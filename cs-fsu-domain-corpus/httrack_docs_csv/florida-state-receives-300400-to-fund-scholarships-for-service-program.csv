The program includes Florida State Master’s Degree students in Computer Science, IT, and Computer Criminology. Focused on Information Assurance education, the SFS program awards scholarship funds to students in exchange for service in the federal government for a period equivalent to the length of their scholarship (up to three years). Federal agencies are able to select from a highly qualified pool of student applicants for internships and permanent positions, and students get a guaranteed job. The SFS program is offered by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and co-sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Each student receives a stipend up to $20,000 for undergrads, or $32,000 for graduates, plus tuition, fees, books, and medical. The program funds will support up to 50 Cyber Scholars for the period 2010-2017. Scholarship recipients shall pursue academic programs in Information Assurance for up to three years: the last undergraduate year (senior) and up to two years at MS level. They will participate as a cohort during their studies and activities, including a summer internship in a federal agency at the end of their first year of support. Mike Burmester, Professor and director of the Center for Security and Assurance in IT (C-SAIT), supports the program initiative and called it “a great program in which students could really value the professional opportunity while receiving an excellent benefit package.” Such an award continues to set FSU apart in a growing STEM-centered field of professional opportunities. It is indeed a great funding award, not only for SFS scholars, but also for those who want to continue to see the best and brightest come from FSU. The quality of this award demands a very selective process. Each candidate should expect to provide cumulative GPA, test scores, letters of reference, and evidence of technical knowledge and leadership skills. This award with this amendment totals $2,236,793 and ends August 31, 2017. For more information contact Mike Burmester and Xiuwen Liu .
