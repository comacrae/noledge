The aim of this project is to develop an alternative execution model, namely, demand-driven execution of imperative programs. As Professor Whalley explained, “In our model, a program that is compiled from a contemporary language is executed in a demand-driven fashion in such a way that both instruction and data-level parallelism can be harvested through compiler-architecture collaboration.” The award includes funding for FSU in the amount of $315,000.
