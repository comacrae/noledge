Its doctoral recipients since that time have continued to contribute to research and education in Computer Science. The effectiveness of the program in educating research scholars and scientists can be seen from the list below. PhD graduates have served as the following: program director at the National Science Foundation; faculty at more than 20 colleges and universities in the US and at universities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East; researchers at government and industrial labs (including EPA, Lucent, Mitre); conference chairs; editors of journals; and contributors to technology companies.
