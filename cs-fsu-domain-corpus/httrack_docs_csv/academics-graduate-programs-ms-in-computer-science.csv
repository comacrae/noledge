In all majors, a student must complete thirty semester hours in computer science courses numbered 5000 or above, including approved CIS 5930 and CIS 6930. At most, one course outside the department at the 5000 or 6000 levels can also count towards the 30 hours if approved by the department chair after the major professor justifies why the outside course is important for the studentâ€™s research. Supervised teaching, supervised research, seminars, directed individual study, internship, and courses with prefix CGS are excluded. For the Computer Science major, at least one course from each of the following three core areas must be taken to satisfy the area requirements: Software COP 5570 Concurrent, Parallel, and Distributed Programming (3) COP 5621 Compiler Construction (3) COP 5725 Database Systems (3) Systems CDA 5155 Computer Architecture (3) CNT 5505 Data and Computer Communications (3) COP 5611 Advanced Operating Systems (3) Theory COT 5310 Theory of Automata and Formal Languages (3) COT 5405 Advanced Algorithms (3) COT 5507 Analytical Methods (3) Computer Science Major MS CS students must complete the undergraduate prerequisites on the following page before graduating, and will likely have to complete a subset of these courses before being admitted to the program. Undergraduate Pre-requisites for MS CS degree . Cybersecurity Major Cybersecurity students must complete the undergraduate prerequisites on the following page before graduating, and will likely have to complete a subset of these courses before being admitted to the MS Cybersecurity major. Undergraduate Pre-requisites for MS Cybersecurity degree . A student in the Cybersecurity major is required to take the following courses: CIS 5370 Computer Security (3) CIS 5371 Cryptography (3) CNT 5412 Network Security, Active and Passive Defenses (3) CNT 5505 Data and Computer Communications (3) CNT 5605 Computer and Network Administration (3) CIS 5627 Offensive Computer Security (3) CAP 5137 Software Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis (3)) This major also includes the award of the Information Security Specialist Certificate . Students are not required to apply to the general CS MS degree beforehand and are allowed to directly apply to the Cybersecurity Major MS program. Computer Network and System Administration Major CNSA students must complete the undergraduate prerequisites on the following page before graduating, and will likely have to complete a subset of these courses before being admitted to the MS CNSA major. Undergraduate Prerequisites for the MS CNSA Degree Program The following courses are the core requirements for the MS CNSA degree. Required Computer Science Courses for the MS CNSA Degree Program CDA 5155 Computer Architecture (3) CNT 5412 Network Security, Active and Passive Defenses (3) CNT 5505 Data and Computer Communications (3) CNT 5605 Computer and Network Administration (3) COP 5611 Advanced Operating Systems (3) COP 5570 Concurrent, Parallel, and Distributed Programming (3) In addition to the required courses, the CNSA program has an experience requirement, and students are required to complete system administration intern-ship(s) to complete this requirement. The CNSA program works with various departments and colleges on the FSU campus to provide local system administration intern-ships for students. It is possible for the MS CNSA students to obtain an NSA-approved training certificate, which facilitates graduates from the program in getting employment with a federal government agency or a government contractor after they graduate. The MS CNSA student can use two of the available elective courses to take COP 5725, Database Systems, and CIS 5370, Computer Security to fulfill the requirements. However, this certificate is limited to U.S. citizens only. A description of the training certificate is available at http://www.cs.fsu.edu/academics/certificate and in the section of Requirements for NSA Training Certificate below."
