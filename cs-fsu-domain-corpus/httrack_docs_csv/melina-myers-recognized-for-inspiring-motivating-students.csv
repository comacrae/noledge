Included was our own Melina Myers, teaching faculty in our CS department. Melina was nominated by junior computer criminology major Jessica Mitchell for encouraging students to find their passion and offering valuable advice. “When I took Melina Myers’ class, her teaching and guidance at office hours and her taking time to get to know me helped me find the love I have for my major and sparked a light in me. I know she is there with advice whether life or computer science related. She has helped me build my confidence in my own skills, and I know that I was taught by one of the best FSU has to offer.” — Jessica Mitchell Outside Link: https://news.fsu.edu/news/university-news/2018/11/30/ten-fsu-faculty-recognized-for-inspiring-and-motivating-students/"
