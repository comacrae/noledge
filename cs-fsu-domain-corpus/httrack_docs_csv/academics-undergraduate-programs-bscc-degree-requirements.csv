Description of Major Criminology and Criminal Justice and Computer Science have collaborated to offer this new interdisciplinary degree in Cyber Criminology. Information-related crime, cyber-forensics, and computer/network security are significant issues that affect all levels of business, government, and academia. Cyber criminology includes both how to use computers to facilitate the study of crime and the study of how crimes are accomplished through the use of computers. Students will be prepared to do graduate work and research in this area, or to be effective employees of government, law enforcement, and industry, thereby filling the pressing need for information technology specialists who can address these issues. Prerequisite Coursework The following may also be used to meet Liberal Studies and/or major requirements COP XXXX (3) Computer Programming MAC X105 (3) College Algebra MAC X140 (3) Precalculus Note: State-wide common prerequisites are always under review. For the most current information and for acceptable alternative courses, visit the “Common Prerequisites Manual.” This is available from the “Student Services” section of http://www.flvc.org . Requirements for Progression to the Upper-Division Major Students must complete at least 52 hours of credit with a minimum grade point average of 2.0 and at least half the required Liberal Studies hours including English and mathematics or an A.A. Degree. Cyber Criminology is not limited access. Mapping Mapping is FSU’s academic advising and monitoring system. Academic progress is monitored each Fall and Spring semester to ensure that students are on course to earn their degree in a timely fashion. Transfer students must meet mapping guidelines to be accepted into their majors. You may view the map for this major at www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/ .
