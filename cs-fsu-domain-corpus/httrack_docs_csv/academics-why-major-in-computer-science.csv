First, our majors rarely have any trouble finding jobs (click for details) . Computer programming and related skills are more in demand every year and the demand for skilled computer scientists far exceeds the supply as shown in the graph below. These skills are also becoming essential in a wide variety of other disciplines, including almost every area of science and engineering. Computer science related jobs in the United States are still increasing, despite offshoring of some positions. A high percentage of our undergraduate students have part time jobs due to the high demand for their skills even before they graduate. Second, our graduates are well paid. Please peruse the information shown below on this page. While the starting salaries for computer scientists can vary over the years, it has consistently been one of the best paying majors for the last several decades. The graph at the bottom of the page shows that the salaries for new graduates in Computer Science has continued to rise and is the best paying profession for the most popular college majors. Last and most importantly, computer science is fun. Programming is similar to solving a puzzle. Once you get the knack of doing it, the process becomes fun. However, computer science is far more than just programming. Keep reading if you wish to know more about our program and peruse our web pages for a description of the courses in the degree.

Computer science is an exceptionally fast-moving field where knowledge is subject to rapid obsolescence and ideas progress swiftly from research to practice. The department therefore seeks to offer technical instruction that stays on the cutting edge of new developments while simultaneously providing each student with a core of intellectual tools that will never become obsolete. The department views skills in communication, mathematics, and algorithmic reasoning as central and the understanding of underlying principles as more important than familiarity with specific technical products. Still, direct hands-on experience is essential to mastering these skills and principles. If students are to be adequately prepared for careers in computer science, they should have extensive experience with machines and software that are state-of-the-art.
