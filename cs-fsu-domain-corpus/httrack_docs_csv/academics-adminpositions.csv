Colloquium Chair (Colloq) (TBD) This person is responsible for organizing and overseeing the departmental colloquium colloquium series. Because this is also a course offered for credit, the job involves both service and teaching. An important guiding principal is that the buck stops with the colloquium chair. To the extent that one delegates, one has to be vigilant that the delegated duties are carried out. For example, if a speaker shows up at the airport and no one is there to greet him, the department gets a black eye and the colloquium chair is responsible. Collect info from faculty about desired speakers to invite. Invite speakers. Notify the publication STATE so the talk will be given publicity. An e-mail address for such is in STATE (the FSU newsletter). Arrange overnight accommodations. Arrange for speaker to be picked up and returned to the airport. Arrange a room for the talk. If there is an honorarium to be paid, work with the CS office manager well in advance of the visit to fill out forms to arrange for that. Well in advance of the visit, have the CS staff person in charge of travel forms make up a TAR form to cover the speakers expenses. Send e-mail to faculty and grads announcing the talk the end of the week before the talk, and the day of the talk. Arrange for the speaker to be entertained. Typically this would involve getting up a group to take the speaker to lunch, and getting up a group to take the speaker to dinner. Sometimes a faculty member will volunteer to entertain the speaker at his/her home. While the speaker is here, take the speaker by the CS staff person responsible for travel to provide social security number and sign the reimbursement forms to receive payments for travel expenses. Maintain a Colloquium web page and arrange to have it linked off the CS dept pages. Example web pages from the Spring 2000 Colloquium series, done by Dr. Levitz, can be seen at http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~baker/dept/colloquium_2000/index.html Manage the Colloquium class; that is, the group of students taking Colloquium for credit.
