The PI’s Dr. Burmester and Dr. Liu will be working together with Dr. Yu from the College of Engineering, to analyze real time multi-layer vulnerabilities and threats of EG infrastructures resulting from untrusted or unexpected behavior. Testing will involve the real time digital simulator (RTDS) hosted by FSUs Center for Advance Power System for hardware-in-the-loop testing. The ultimate goal is to develop an architecture that integrates well established trusted computing engines, trusted key management services, and cryptographic tools to support resiliency for critical infrastructure protection. The purpose of the National CAE designation program is to promote higher education in IA and CD and prepare a growing number of IA/CD professionals to meet the need to reduce vulnerabilities in the Nation’s networks. The initial National CAE in IA Education (CAE/IAE) program was started by NSA in 1998, with DHS joining as a partner in 2004 in response to the President’s National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. Congratulations to Dr. Burmester, Dr. Liu, and Dr. Yu for their outstanding research efforts."
