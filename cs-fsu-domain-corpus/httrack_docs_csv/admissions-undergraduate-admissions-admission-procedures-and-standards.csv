Students interested in applying to the program should apply online through the Office of Admissions webpage and submit any supporting documents directly to their office. Minimum Admission Criteria Students still in high school who are considering Computer Science are advised to study higher level math courses and, if possible, complete AP, IB, or CLEP tests and potentially earn college credit. Students working on their AA are advised to review the Common Course Prerequisites for their potential major in the Academic Guide . Students may be admitted into the University without completing prerequisites, but may not be admitted to the major until they are completed. A student who has accumulated more than five grades below “C-“ (including grades of “U”) in mathematics, statistics, science, or computer science courses taken for college credit at The Florida State University or elsewhere, whether repeated or not, will not be permitted to continue as a major in the department."
