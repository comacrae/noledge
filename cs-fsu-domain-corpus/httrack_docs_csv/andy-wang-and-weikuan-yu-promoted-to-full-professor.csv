Andy Wang received his Ph.D. and M.S. in computer science from UCLA in 2003 and 1998, and his B.S. from UC Berkeley in 1995. He joined the Department of Computer Science at Florida State University in 2003. His research interests include file systems, optimistic peer replication, performance evaluation, ad hoc network routing, operating systems, and distributed systems. Dr. Yu has been an Associate Professor at Florida State University since 2015. Prior to that, he held positions in Auburn University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Dr. Yu’s areas of specialization include big data, high-performance computing, computer architecture, file and storage systems, and interdisciplinary research on computational genomics. He earned his PhD in Computer Science and MS in Neurobiology from the Ohio State University. Dr. Yu has published more than 80 papers, many of which in top conferences and journals such as Supercomputing, SigMetrics, PACT, IPDPS, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, and IEEE Transactions on Computers. Dr. Yu’s research has been supported in part by NASA, DOE (ORNL and LLNL), NSF, Alabama Department of Commerce, Mellanox, Intel, NVIDIA, Scitor, and Auburn University, with Yu as the PI for nearly $4M in external grants. In addition to his significant research contributions to the computer science field, Dr. Yu has advised many Master’s and Ph.D. students, many of whom have landed jobs in prestigious industrial and research organizations upon graduation. Former students under his leadership have joined organizations such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Yahoo, Intel, Boeing, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Amazon, and other industry positions. Also, Dr. Yu’s research won the 2012 Alabama Innovation Award and the First Prize of 2012 ACM Student Research Competition Grand Finals. Yu is a senior member of IEEE and member of AAAS, ACM and USENIX."
