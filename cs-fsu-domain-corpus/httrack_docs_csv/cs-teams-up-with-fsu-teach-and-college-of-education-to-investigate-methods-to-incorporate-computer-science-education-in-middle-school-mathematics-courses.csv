Sep 22, 2016 | News CS faculty Prof. Xin Yuan and Prof. David Whalley team up with Prof. Ellen Granger and Prof. Sherry Southerland from  FSU-Teach and Prof. Christine Larson from College of Education in a project to investigate methods to incorporate Computer  Science education in middle school mathematics courses. This is a three-year project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the amount of $1.1 Million. In this project, the team will work with middle-school teachers to develop and pilot-test Computer Science modules to be integrated into middle-school general-mathematics courses (grades 6, 7, and 8). Incorporating Computer Science modules in mathematics courses may also help to reinforce understanding of mathematics. By targeting the middle school years, the project seeks to not only prepare students with foundational Computer Science background to enable success in high-school CS courses, but also to provide positive engagement for all students in early experiences designed to foster and maintain interest in CS."
