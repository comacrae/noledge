Dr. Viet Tung Hoang Receives NSF CAREER Award | Dr. Viet Tung Hoang Receives NSF CAREER Award FSUâ€™s Computer Science faculty member Viet Tung Hoang was awarded the prestigious National Science Foundation CAREER Award of $563,971 over a duration of 5 years. The focus of the project is to improve the method of encrypting credit-card numbers, the randomness generation for cryptographic use, and the time-memory tradeoff in the security analysis of encryption. To achieve these goals, the project aims to develop analytic techniques that are useful for a wide range of cryptographic applications. Another goal of the project is to develop a problem-solving course to help senior undergraduates and first-year graduates to undertake research in theoretical computer science.
