Certificate | Certificate CNSS has discontinued the certificate program NSTISSI 4011 and CNSS4014 as of January 1, 2015. In April 2000, the NSA’s Information Assurance Directorate designated Florida State University as having met the training standards of the Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation . This process involved assessing the quality of FSU’s curriculum by a formal, rigorous training standard. FSU has, for the third time, renewed its certification to train specialists under the Committee of National Security Systems (CNSS) standards NSTISSI standard 4011 “Information Security Professionals”. As of August 2008, the university is also certified to offer the additional professional standard of CNSS 4014 for “Information Security Officers”. By achieving these designations, FSU students that complete the courses specified in the program are recognized as having been trained to serve as Information Systems Security Professionals or Information Systems Security Officers and receive a certificate that says the student “has satisfactorily completed an educational program certified by CNSS as compliant with NSTISSI No. 4011 or CNSS 4014 . ” This certificate is only available to degree-seeking undergraduate and graduate students at FSU that complete the core courses and their prerequisites. The certificate must be requested by the student in the same term of graduation as the student’s degree program. The requirements to meet the standards for the CNSSI-4014 (Security Officer) certificate are as follows: Undergraduate Level Graduate Level COP 4710 Theory and Structures of Databases COP 5725 Database Systems CIS 4360 Introduction to Computer Security CIS 5370 Computer Security CNT 4406 Network Security and Cryptography CNT 5412 Network Security, Active and Passive Defenses CNT 4504 Introduction to Computer Networks CNT 5505 Data and Computer Communications CNT 4603 Computer and Network System Administration CNT 5605 Computer and Network Administration COP 4610 Operating Systems and Concurrent Programming COP 5611 Advanced Operating Systems In order to obtain the additional certificate for completion of the NSTISSI-4011 (Security Professional) requirements, students must also take the following core courses: CDA 3101 Computer Organization COP 3330 Object-Oriented Programming 1.
