Dr. Xifeng Gao awarded an NSF grant for Curved Mesh Generation and Analysis | Dr. Xifeng Gao awarded an NSF grant for Curved Mesh Generation and Analysis FSU Computer Science Prof. Xifeng Gao recently received a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for his project “Robust High Order Meshing and Analysis for Design Pipeline Automation”. The project is a collaborative effort between Florida State University and New York University. The goal of this project is to develop a robust meshing pipeline that generates curvilinear elements that can reproduce both CAD models and subdivision surfaces with high fidelity, uses a direct measure of approximation errors, leading to coarse meshes that are designed to match the simulation accuracy required by applications, and can robustly and automatically process large collections of real-world CAD models. For interactive applications, the combination of the generated curved elements and the new error estimate will lead to extremely coarse models ideal for fast simulation. In CAD settings, it will for the first time enable precise modeling of complex scenarios such as the driving of a screw or the simulations of the stress concentration on fillets. The approach will close the gap between design tools, providing an automatic conversion of curved geometry to analysis-suitable curved meshes. The awarded funding for FSU is in the amount of $260,722.
