Dr. Jie Yang awarded $459K NSF grant for Wireless Sensing Research | Dr. Jie Yang awarded $459K NSF grant for Wireless Sensing Research FSU Department of Computer Science Professor Jie Yang has been awarded a new NSF grant for his project “Towards Ubiquitous Sensing With Commodity Wi-Fi”. The aim of the project is to build a commodity WiFi-based ubiquitous sensing system that can simultaneously sense multiple persons and provides quantifiable gesture recognition without requiring environment-dependent training. The outcome of this project can be directly adopted by industry and will have a societal impact by facilitating a variety of applications such as HCI, smart homes, mobile healthcare, and security surveillance, among others. The award includes funding for FSU in the amount of $459,000 for three years.
