Advanced Computation and Information Systems (ACIS) Lab | Advanced Computation and Information Systems (ACIS) Lab The lab has eight PS3 machines for research. The PS3â€™s will serve the dedicated cycles we need to run experiments with CPU-bound forecast models. We are also interested in programming models and compilation techniques for heterogeneous multicore systems for which the machine will serve as a testbed.
