Dr. David Whalley awarded $600K NSF grant for Instruction-Level Parallelism Research | Dr. David Whalley awarded $600K NSF grant for Instruction-Level Parallelism Research FSU Department of Computer Science Professor David Whalley has been awarded a new NSF grant for his project “Statically Controlled Asynchronous Lane Execution (SCALE)”. The project is a collaborative effort between FSU and a colleague from Michigan Technological University. The aim of the project is to support separate asynchronous execution lanes where dependencies between instructions in different lanes are statically identified by the compiler to provide inter-lane synchronization. As implied by its name, the SCALE approach has the ability to scale to different types and levels of parallelism. The goal is to meet or exceed the performance of a traditional superscalar processor while approaching the energy efficiency of a very long instruction word (VLIW) processor. The award includes funding for FSU in the amount of $600,000. For more information, please visit: FSU researcher receives NSF funding to make higher-performing computer apps
