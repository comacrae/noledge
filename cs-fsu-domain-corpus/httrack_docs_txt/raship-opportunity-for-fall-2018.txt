A selected student should also be able to understand existing code implementations and make modifications as needed. If you believe you can contribute to this project then first email Dr. Aggarwal a resume and he will contact you as follow up. Include information about your skills, GPA, etc.  Also indicate in your email if you currently (in fall) have TA funding from the department as some existing TA funding would be preferred.
