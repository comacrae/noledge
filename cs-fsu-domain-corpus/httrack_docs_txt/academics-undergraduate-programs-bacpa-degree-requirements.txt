Description of Major This major provides a broad-based background sufficient for entry to a career in computing. It provides an applications view of computing, emphasizing the interdependence of programming, object orientation, and software design and engineering. This major develops core competencies in programming, data structures, software engineering, and computer organization. It allows opportunities to study a range of other aspects of computer and information science, such as web programming, mobile programming, cybersecurity, digital forensics, databases and data engineering, data communication and networks, computer and network systems administration, computer systems, and theoretical computer science. Every student can expect to become proficient at programming in C++/C, and Assembly Language. Additionally, students will be exposed to other languages such as Java, Python, C#, Objective-C, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, CSS, HTML, Scheme, and Prolog. This major is available on Tallahassee campus only. The BA in CPApp program is intended to allow students flexibility in combining computing with other interests. The BA program requires 9 hours of humanities/history beyond Liberal Studies. Students in this program should meet with an advisor to select a minor from an approved list. The BA in CPApp major is not ABET/CAC accredited and is not intended to provide sufficient preparation in computer science theory for graduate work in computer science. Prerequisite Coursework: MAC X3111 (4) Calculus I Note: State-wide common prerequisites are always under review. For the most current information and for acceptable alternative courses, visit the “Common Prerequisites Manual.” This is available from the “Student Services” section of http://www.flvc.org . Requirements for graduation in the College of Arts and Sciences include : The College of Arts and Science requires proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate (2220 or equivalent) level or sign language through the advanced (2614 or equivalent) level. Foreign language courses are not available via distance learning at FSU. Admissions/Continuation Requirements to the Major Program of Studies Students should complete the prerequisite coursework with a grade of C- or higher to be considered for entrance to the major program of study.
