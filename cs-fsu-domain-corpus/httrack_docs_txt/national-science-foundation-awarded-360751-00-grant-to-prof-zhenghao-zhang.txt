Professor Zhenghao Zhang awarded a grant for wireless networks research | Professor Zhenghao Zhang awarded a grant for wireless networks research The National Science Foundation (NSF) recently awarded a 3-year, $360,751.00 grant to Prof. Zhenghao Zhang for his research in wireless networks. The project is titled “NeTS: Small: Theory and Applications of Sparse Approximations of the Channel State Information in Wi-Fi Networks.” The focus of this project is to design efficient methods for measuring, compressing, and utilizing the Channel State Information (CSI) of Wi-Fi networks based on the discovery made by Prof. Zhang and his student Avishek Mukherjee that the CSI can be approximated very well by very few sinusoids in most Wi-Fi networks. As the CSI is the key to many operations, such as data modulation in MU-MIMO transmissions, this project will likely remove a major bottleneck in Wi-Fi networks and allow users to enjoy higher speed and better service.
