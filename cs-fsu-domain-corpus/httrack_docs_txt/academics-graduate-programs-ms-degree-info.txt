Course-based Option A student under the course-based option must take ten (10) courses (30 semester hours) at or above the 5000 level, including at least one course from each of the three core areas described above. Approved CIS 5930/6930 Special Topics are counted towards the 10 courses, but supervised teaching, supervised research, seminars, DIS, CIS 5970 and CIS 5915 cannot be included. A student must earn a grade of B+ or higher for at least 6 of the 10 courses in order to graduate in the course-based option. The student must also register for CIS 8966, Master’s Comprehensive Exam (0) the semester of graduation (effective Spring 2005). Supervisory Committee For the thesis and project options, it is the student’s responsibility to form a supervisory committee regardless of his or her selected major. No later than the start of work on the thesis or project, the student will secure the consent of an eligible computer science faculty member to serve as the major professor. In consultation with the major professor, the student will secure the consent of at least two additional graduate faculty members to serve as the supervisory committee, chaired by the major professor. Major requirements In all majors, a student must complete thirty semester hours in computer science courses numbered 5000 or above, including approved CIS 5930 and CIS 6930. At most, one course outside the department at the 5000 or 6000 level can also count towards the 30 hours if approved by the department chair after the major professor justifies why the outside course is important for the student’s research. Supervised teaching, supervised research, seminars, directed individual study, internship, and courses with prefix CGS are excluded.
