Dr. Zhao Awarded $450k Research Grant by Air Force | Dr. Zhao Awarded $450k Research Grant by Air Force Prof. Peixiang Zhao has been awarded a $450,000, three-year grant from the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)’s Young Investigator Research Program (YIP). Peixiang is one of 45 scientists and engineers to share some $19.9 million in grants from this year’s AFOSR YIP program. The program is open to researchers in the U.S. who have received a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in the last five years and demonstrate “exceptional ability and promise for conducting basic research.” Peixiang’s proposal was titled “Graphs at Your Fingertips: Managing and Summarizing Big Graphs.” In this project, Peixiang will work with his students to design and develop scalable graph management and summarization solutions that can simplify real-world graphs of extreme scale, heterogeneity, and dynamics into concise, structure-enriched, and quality-preserving summaries with the goal of enabling efficient, cost-effective, scalable, and interactive management and computation for big graphs.
