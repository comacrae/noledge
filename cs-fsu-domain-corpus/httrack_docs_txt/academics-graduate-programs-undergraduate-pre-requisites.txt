Undergraduate pre-requisites | Undergraduate pre-requisites For those students who do NOT have an undergraduate BS degree in Computer Science, the following courses or their equivalents at another institution must be completed before the graduate PhD CS or MS CS degree will be awarded. Each newly admitted student must meet with the Director of Graduate Studies to complete a form indicating if any of the following must be taken. The form will be maintained in the student’s file and checked during the departmental graduation check. Note that if a student has a BS in CS from another institution (not FSU) there may be one or more courses that we require that were not required at the student’s institution. These courses must be taken prior to graduation. An undergraduate pre-requisite is considered fulfilled when a grade of B- or better is received in the undergraduate course or when an S is received in the co-listed CGS 5xxx graduate course.
