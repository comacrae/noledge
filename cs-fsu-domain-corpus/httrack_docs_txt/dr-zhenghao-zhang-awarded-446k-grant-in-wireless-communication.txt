Dr. Zhenghao Zhang awarded $446k grant in Wireless Communication | Dr. Zhenghao Zhang awarded $446k grant in Wireless Communication Dr. Zhenghao Zhang was awarded funding by the National Science Foundation. The title of Dr. Zhang’s research is “CNS Core: Small: Supporting Massive Wireless Connections in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) with Multiple Zadoff-Chu (MZC) sequences.” The amount is $446,751. Zhang is the sole PI of this grant.  In this project, a novel wireless communication technology for Low Power Wide Area Network will be investigated. The technology is based on modulating data on the Zadoff-Chu sequence, and is expected to  outperform the existing technologies significantly in capacity and communication range.
