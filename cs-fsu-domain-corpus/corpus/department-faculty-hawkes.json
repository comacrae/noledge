This is in response to the increasing need for high-performance disaster-tolerant networks that allow for the use of backup sites at a significant distance from the main site, thus ensuring a single disaster will not take down both sites. Included in this work are the development of fault-tolerant network protocols, quality of service issues, and reliability in end-to-end performance for the transfer of very large data sets. The corresponding infrastructure must be both cost-effective and robust.", "meta": {"url": "www.cs.fsu.edu/department/faculty/hawkes/"}}
