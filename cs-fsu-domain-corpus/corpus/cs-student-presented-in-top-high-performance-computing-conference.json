{"content": "CS Student Presented in Top High Performance Computing Conference | CS Student Presented in Top High Performance Computing Conference Peyman Faizian, a PhD student from the CS Department, has published a full paper in the prestigious IEEE/ACM SC: the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, held in November 2017 in Denver, Colorado. This is one of the top conferences in the High Performance Computing area. The paper, titled \u201cA Comparative Study of SDN and Adaptive Routing on Dragonfly Networks\u201d describes the Software Defined Networking (SDN) techniques developed for the state-of-the-art HPC interconnection networks, and compares the performance of Software Defined Networking (SDN) with the state-of-the-art globally adaptive routing schemes used in the current generation supercomputers. This research is a part of a Software Defined Networking project in and is performed in collaboration with Md Atiqul Mollah and Zhou Tong under the supervision of Prof. Xin Yuan and Mike Lang, a collaborator from Los Alamos National Laboratory. Peyman is a member of the CS EXPLORER laboratory (http://explorer.cs.fsu.edu).", "meta": {"url": "www.cs.fsu.edu/cs-student-presented-in-top-high-performance-computing-conference/"}}
