{"content": "FSU Professor David Whalley Awarded NSF Project Grant | FSU Professor David Whalley Awarded NSF Project Grant FSU Department of Computer Science Professor David Whalley has been awarded a new NSF grant for his project \u201cSphinx: Combining Data and Instruction Level Parallelism through Demand Driven Execution of Imperative Programs.\u201d The project is a collaborative effort between FSU, and a colleague from Michigan Technological University. The aim of this project is to develop an alternative execution model, namely, demand-driven execution of imperative programs. As Professor Whalley explained, \u201cIn our model, a program that is compiled from a contemporary language is executed in a demand-driven fashion in such a way that both instruction and data-level parallelism can be harvested through compiler-architecture collaboration.\u201d The award includes funding for FSU in the amount of $315,000.
