{"content": "Viet Tung Hoang | Viet Tung Hoang Assistant Professor Office: Telephone: E-Mail: Visit Personal Page (no link) Research Dr.  Hoang\u2019s research area is cryptography, with a practice-oriented theme. His line of research aims to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of cryptography, giving products of genuine utility that are theoretically justified yet faster than heuristic solutions. For example, he has built a new authenticated encryption scheme AEZ to improve both security and speed of standardized schemes underlying Internet protocols such as HTTPS, IPSec, and WPA2. AEZ is currently a second-round candidate in the standardization competition CAESAR. Dr. Hoang\u2019s research papers earned the Best Honorable Mention at EUROCRYPT 2015 and Best Paper Award at CCS 2015.", "meta": {"url": "www.cs.fsu.edu/department/faculty/hoang/"}}
