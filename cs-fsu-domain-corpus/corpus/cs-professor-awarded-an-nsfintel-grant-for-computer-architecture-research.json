{"content": "CS professor awarded an NSF/Intel grant for computer architecture research | CS professor awarded an NSF/Intel grant for computer architecture research FSU Department of Computer Science Professor David Whalley has been awarded a new NSF/Intel grant for his project \u201cDependent ILP: Dynamic Hoisting and Eager Scheduling of Dependent Instructions.\u201d  The project is a collaborative effort between FSU and a colleague from Michigan Technological University.  The aim of the project is to combine a traditional superscalar processor architecture with a dataflow style pipeline that makes efficient early fetching and dispatching of dependent instructions possible.  The award includes funding for FSU in the amount of $220,000.", "meta": {"url": "www.cs.fsu.edu/cs-professor-awarded-an-nsfintel-grant-for-computer-architecture-research/"}}
