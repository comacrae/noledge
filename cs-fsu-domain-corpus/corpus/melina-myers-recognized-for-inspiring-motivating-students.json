Included was our own Melina Myers, teaching faculty in our CS department. Melina was nominated by junior computer criminology major Jessica Mitchell for encouraging students to find their passion and offering valuable advice. \u201cWhen I took Melina Myers\u2019 class, her teaching and guidance at office hours and her taking time to get to know me helped me find the love I have for my major and sparked a light in me.
