Yu\u2019s project, titled \u201cDesign and Development of Big Data Analytics on Shared Memory Programming Models\u201d will conduct research and development activities to develop an integrated framework for enabling big data analytics on high-performance computing platforms. By enabling the efficient use of shared memory programming models, this new project will enable the use of HPC computer systems for scalable and efficient data-intensive applications on leadership computing facilities. The resulting prototype will be incorporated to large-scale file systems at DOE computing facilities hosted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Dr. Yu is a tenured Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Florida State University (FSU). He served as a Research Staff Member at Oak Ridge National Lab until 2009, and then an assistant and associate professor at Auburn University until 2015. He has founded the Parallel Architecture and Systems Laboratory (PASL) at FSU. Dr. Yu\u2019s research interests include a multitude of technical areas including; data mining and analytics of big data and social networks, parallel computer systems and architecture, high speed interconnects, cloud computing, computational biology and climate modeling, and I/O systems.", "meta": {"url": "www.cs.fsu.edu/yu-ornl-grant/"}}
