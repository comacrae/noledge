{"content": "Cybersecurity Major in MS in Computer Science Program | Cybersecurity Major in MS in Computer Science Program The number of hours for the graduate degree as described on this web page will be effective in Summer 2018. In all majors, a student must complete thirty semester hours in computer science courses numbered 5000 or above, including approved CIS 5930 and CIS 6930. At most, one course outside the department at the 5000 or 6000 levels can also count towards the 30 hours if approved by the department chair after the major professor justifies why the outside course is important for the student\u2019s research.
