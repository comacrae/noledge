{"content": "BS Degree Program Mission, Educational Objectives & Student Outcomes (Up to Summer 2020) | BS Degree Program Mission, Educational Objectives & Student Outcomes (Up to Summer 2020) The following information is applicable from Fall 2019. For previous information please check this link. The primary mission of the undergraduate program in Computer Science is to provide a high quality undergraduate educational program. To this end, the department seeks continually to strengthen the faculty and the education program to assure that students are well prepared for careers in the field of Computer Science. The Computer Science department\u2019s Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org . ABET is the recognized accrediting body of college and university programs in engineering, computing, technology and applied science. Our BS CS program is characterized by Program Educational Objectives and Student Outcomes. The program educational objectives describe expected accomplishments of our graduates of the BS program and is consistent with the mission of the department. The student outcomes define the criteria that prepare students to attain the program objectives. The department periodically assesses and evaluates the BS curriculum for consistency with each student outcome and educational objective with the goal to ensure that each student outcome can be attained. This regular evaluation is used to identify program weaknesses, put improvements in place and re-evaluate the effectiveness of those improvements; resulting in continuous improvement of the program. This assures that our students receive a high-quality education. Departmental Mission Statement To strive for excellence in advancing, applying, and imparting knowledge in computer science through comprehensive educational programs, research in collaboration with industry and government, and dissemination through scholarly products; To produce outstanding computer science professionals who have the fundamental knowledge, problem-solving skills, and life-long learning capability to advance their careers; To disseminate computer science knowledge to students and professionals in other disciplines, and To provide service to the university community, professional societies, local communities, the state, and the nation. The program educational objectives for the Bachelors of Science degree program in Computer Science is to produce graduates who will: Goal 1: Problem solving and presentation Engage in the practice of computer science to identify and solve significant problems across a broad range of application areas, and communicate these solutions professionally. Goal 2: Theoretical foundations Apply sound principles of the theoretical foundations and mathematical bases of computer science in solving complex problems. Goal 3: Impact and Responsibility Embrace the breadth of impact of computing on society, and apply ethical, social and professional responsibilities in the profession. Goal 4: Life-long learning Adapt to new technologies, tools and methodologies to remain at the leading edge of computer science developments and practice in the profession and in the academic field. BS Degree Student Outcomes ABET/CAC Outcomes Note that SMALC/SACS outcomes are defined right after these outcomes. A1. Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions. SMALC/SACS outcome: SA A2. Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program\u2019s discipline. SMALC/SACS outcome: SB A3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts. SMALC/SACS outcomes: SC and SD A4. Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgements in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles. SMALC/SACS outcome: SE A5. Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program\u2019s discipline. SMALC/SACS outcome: SF A6. Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions. SMALC/SACS outcomes: SG and SH The acceptance and use of the program educational objectives and student outcomes of the BS degree program are periodically assessed by the CS faculty, by the CS Board of Advisors, and by the officers of the FSU ACM Student Chapter. SMALC/SACS FSU Institutional Effectiveness Outcomes The Florida State University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The accreditation standards require the use of the State Mandated Academic Learning Compacts (SMALC) to define the student outcomes. The SMALC/SACS outcomes SA to SH to attain the learning outcomes listed below: SA) Programming Competence: Upon completion of the program, the student will be able to design and create a programming solution for a problem. Assessment: A programming assignment in COP4530. SB) Software Analysis and Development: Upon completion of the program, the student will be able to analyze the requirement of a complex software system and to design and develop the system based on the requirement. Assessment: capstone group project in revised CEN4020. SC) Technical Writing: Upon completion of the program, the student will be able to produce a technical document, written to professional standards. Assessment: a writing assignment in CIS3250 SD) Oral Presentation: Upon completion of the program, the student will be able to formulate and deliver an effective oral presentation on a technical software-related subject or a research topic. Assessment: a presentation assignment in revised CEN4020. SE) Ethics and Responsibility: Upon completion of the program, the student will be able to explain the professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities of a computing professional. Assessment: assignment or exam in CIS3250. SF) Teamwork: Upon completion of the program, the student will be able to function effectively as a team member or leader in the analysis, design, and implementation of a software system. Assessment: capstone group project in revised CEN4020. SG) Computing Theory: Upon completion of the program, the student will be able to apply computing theory and fundamentals to decide the computability of a problem. Assessment: an assignment in COT4420 SH) Computational Complexity: Upon completion of the program, the student will be able to analyze the computational complexity of algorithms used in the solution of a programming problem, and to evaluate the performance trade-offs of alternative data structures and algorithms. Assessment: an assignment in COP4530 The SMALC/SACS outcomes for the BS degree are related to the ABET/CAC student outcomes as follows.
