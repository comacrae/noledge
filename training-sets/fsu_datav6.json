The PI’s Dr. Burmester and Dr. Liu will be working together with Dr. Yu from the College of Engineering, to analyze real time multi-layer vulnerabilities and threats of EG infrastructures resulting from untrusted or unexpected behavior. Testing will involve the real time digital simulator (RTDS) hosted by FSUs Center for Advance Power System for hardware-in-the-loop testing. The ultimate goal is to develop an architecture that integrates well established trusted computing engines, trusted key management services, and cryptographic tools to support resiliency for critical infrastructure protection. The purpose of the National CAE designation program is to promote higher education in IA and CD and prepare a growing number of IA/CD professionals to meet the need to reduce vulnerabilities in the Nation’s networks. The initial National CAE in IA Education (CAE/IAE) program was started by NSA in 1998, with DHS joining as a partner in 2004 in response to the President’s National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.

The CS Expo is one of the department’s key annual events for both student and alumni, that takes place to showcase emerging technological projects, encourage innovative dialogue, and lets everyone exchange experiences in the world of tech. There are several components of the fair including a “Grad-Made-Good” talk, door prizes, poster contests, and a software demo contest. This most important part of this year’s event included two talks from keynote speaker Dr. Prasad Kulkarni from University of Kansas, and an invited talk from the David Lawson of NewSci. Lawson is well known around Tallahassee’s community of tech startups for being a partner at Domi Ventures, and for advising several companies including Return on Mission, Agile Equity, Small Act, and HG Data. During his talk he went into the new innovations in Big Data and the things NewSci is doing in regards to the field. Lawson was followed by Dr. Kulkarni who is currently an Associate Professor in the EECS department at the University of Kansas and is well known for being a Ph.D. recipient from FSU in 2007. He went into detail of his graduate experiences here at the university and how it has carried over in his professional field. Prasad also heads the Compilers, Architectures, and Runtime Systems (CARS) research group at KU and specializes in the efficiency in modern multi-core machines and embedded systems. The event also featured several student talks from students here in the department. CS student Javier Escobar presented his research project entitled: Automatic Categorization of Software Libraries Using Bytecode, where his proposed techniques could potentially help software developers use more efficient search methods for large repositories. Another student, Shiva Krishna Imminni, presented research on a more Python focused search engine project entitled PyQuery: A Search Engine for Python Packages and Modules. CS student Yue Chen held a talk based on his project entitled Harvesting Developer Credentials in Android Apps. His efforts explored the challenges of credentials in third party apps and safer ways to recover such information. CS Student Martin Brown delivered an exceptional talk on open-source benchmark suites designed to expose the complex interactions between components of the Android software stack in his presentation entitled Agave: a Benchmark Suite Addressing AndroidSystem Complexity. Finally, Peyman Faizian delivered a talk on The Performance of Random Regular Topologies. The event eventually closed out with student awards and closing remarks. The student talk winners were Martin Brown and Peyman Faizian, the best demo was given by Ali Hamie and the best poster was presented by Josh Garlitos. According to event organizers all students who participated in each contest did a wonderful job in their respective categories. Special thanks goes out to Jie Yang, Margareta Ackerman, and ACM student members Sharanya Jayaraman, David Perez, and Preston Hamlin who all assisted main event organizer Caitlin Carnahan with the event.",

The team is comprised of Professor Srinivasan and researchers from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University and Arizona State University. The research is imperative for limiting the amount of air travel passengers exposed to the disease via unknown persons infected on the plane. Funding for the project comes via the National Science Foundation and its Rapid Response Research Grant fund dedicated to facilitating researchers finding solutions for the disease. “Predicting exact human response to policy decisions is difficult. Rather, we aim to identify vulnerabilities in different policy options given inherent uncertainties,” Dr. Srinivasan said. “And we need to determine if some of these vulnerabilities would lead to disastrous consequences, such as causing an epidemic in the US.” Srinivasan is a supercomputing whiz: his knowledge is needed for the simulations to be completed in a timely matter. Srinivasan’s expertise on this project stems from a new research direction he spearheaded with his Fulbright grant on “Supercomputing for policy decisions.” The software and modeling infrastructure this team develops could be applied to other contagious disease scenarios as well. He hopes that they will be ready with a solution when the next outbreak threatens human well-being. Congratulations to Dr. Srinivasan for once again proving computing knowledge is applicable to the many real-world problems in our everyday lives.",

Her recent work on voice liveness detection has been published in a paper, titled “VoiceLive: A Phoneme Localization based Liveness Detection for Voice Authentication on Smartphones” in ACM CCS 2016, a top tier conference in the Security area. The paper is co-authored with her lab-mate Sheng Tan, Prof. Jie Yang, and Prof. Yingying Chen at Stevens Institute of Technology. In the paper, Linghan proposed VoiceLive, a practical liveness detection system for voice authentication on smartphones. It works by leveraging the user’s unique vocal system and the stereo recording of smartphones. It performs liveness detection by measuring TDoA changes of a sequence of phoneme sounds from the two microphones of a smartphone. Experimental evaluation shows that VoiceLive achieves over 99% detection accuracy at around 1% Equal Error Rate (EER). Results also show that VoiceLive is robust to different phone placements and is compatible to different sampling rates and phone models.",

His recent paper titled “Adaptive Android Kernel Live Patching” has been published in USENIX Security 2017, a top-tier conference in security and privacy. In this paper, Yue tries to address an important real-world problem in which most Android devices are never timely updated. Kernel vulnerabilities in these devices pose a serious threat to user security and privacy because the kernel is the foundation of security and trust for the whole device. To protect users from kernel exploits, Yue, together with other researchers, proposed KARMA, an adaptive kernel live patching system for Android kernels. A defining feature of KARMA is that it can automatically adapt a reference patch to different devices, significantly reducing the window of vulnerability. This paper is a collaboration with researchers from the Baidu X-lab. KARMA is a key component in the forthcoming OASES open initiative ( https://oases.io/ ).",

His recent work on wireless sensing has been published in a paper, titled “WiFinger: Leveraging Commodity WiFi for Fine-grained Finger Gesture Recognition” and co-authored with Prof. Jie Yang in ACM Mobihoc 2016, a top tier conference in the Mobile and Wireless Computing area. In the paper, Sheng proposed a finger gesture recognition system by using a single commodity WiFi device without requiring user to wear any sensors. The proposed system is easily deployable on existing WiFi devices without using any dedicated or specialized hardware.  Experimental evaluation in both home and office environments demonstrates that WiFinger can achieve over 93% recognition accuracy and is robust to both environment changes and individual diversity. Results also show that it can work with WiFi beacon signals and provides accurate gesture recognition under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.",

A recent trend in automated software verification is to delegate the computational tasks to solvers for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and Constrained Horn Clauses (CHC). The latter allows synthesizing inductive invariants and enables sound (but possibly incomplete) reasoning about loopy programs. Existing approaches to solving CHC are limited mainly to lightweight and imprecise first-order theories or expensive and impractical bit-precise reasoning. Supporting arrays and algebraic data types (ADT) is challenging due to the presence of quantifiers, but it is needed for a range of real-world applications such as Code-Level Model Checking in the Software Development Workflow by Amazon Web Services (called AWS C Common library). This proposal aims to extend a successful technique for CHC solving, implemented in a tool called FreqHorn and maintained at FSU. We will focus on the development of an automated converter from the AWS verification language to CHC, and we will exploit various different modeling paradigms that could serve to improve the scalability of verification. The award includes funding in the amount of $60,000 for one year.",

Today, many real-world cryptographic schemes are based on the provable-security paradigm, certifying their security via some proofs. However, in several important settings, existing proofs for the in-use constructions give weak security bounds, even to the extent that these results are not meaningful. Moreover, many proofs in the literature are buggy, giving false confidence on the security of actually vulnerable constructions. Even worse, practitioners may introduce seemingly harmless optimizations into a secure scheme, only to find out later that they completely undermine the security. In this project, Prof. Hoang aims to partially address these issues from several fronts: (1) improving security guarantees of important applications, (2) weeding out insecure optimizations of real-world protocols by giving attacks, and (3) developing tools for automatic verification of cryptographic proofs.",

The project is a collaborative effort between Florida State University and New York University. The goal of this project is to develop a robust meshing pipeline that generates curvilinear elements that can reproduce both CAD models and subdivision surfaces with high fidelity, uses a direct measure of approximation errors, leading to coarse meshes that are designed to match the simulation accuracy required by applications, and can robustly and automatically process large collections of real-world CAD models. For interactive applications, the combination of the generated curved elements and the new error estimate will lead to extremely coarse models ideal for fast simulation. In CAD settings, it will for the first time enable precise modeling of complex scenarios such as the driving of a screw or the simulations of the stress concentration on fillets. The approach will close the gap between design tools, providing an automatic conversion of curved geometry to analysis-suitable curved meshes.

The program includes Florida State Master’s Degree students in Computer Science, IT, and Computer Criminology. Focused on Information Assurance education, the SFS program awards scholarship funds to students in exchange for service in the federal government for a period equivalent to the length of their scholarship (up to three years). Federal agencies are able to select from a highly qualified pool of student applicants for internships and permanent positions, and students get a guaranteed job. The SFS program is offered by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and co-sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Each student receives a stipend up to $20,000 for undergrads, or $32,000 for graduates, plus tuition, fees, books, and medical. The program funds will support up to 50 Cyber Scholars for the period 2010-2017. Scholarship recipients shall pursue academic programs in Information Assurance for up to three years: the last undergraduate year (senior) and up to two years at MS level. They will participate as a cohort during their studies and activities, including a summer internship in a federal agency at the end of their first year of support. Mike Burmester, Professor and director of the Center for Security and Assurance in IT (C-SAIT), supports the program initiative and called it “a great program in which students could really value the professional opportunity while receiving an excellent benefit package.” Such an award continues to set FSU apart in a growing STEM-centered field of professional opportunities. It is indeed a great funding award, not only for SFS scholars, but also for those who want to continue to see the best and brightest come from FSU. The quality of this award demands a very selective process. Each candidate should expect to provide cumulative GPA, test scores, letters of reference, and evidence of technical knowledge and leadership skills. This award with this amendment totals $2,236,793 and ends August 31, 2017. For more information contact Mike Burmester and Xiuwen Liu .

Yu’s project, titled “A Distributed File System for Burst Buffers on HPC Systems” will conduct research and development activities to develop a distributed file system for burst buffers. Burst buffers are being introduced into high performance computing (HPC) storage architectures as a mechanism for solving the scalability problems associated with I/O from large-scale runs. By enabling the efficient use of burst buffers, this new project will address the needs of scalable performance and reliability across distributed burst buffers for data-intensive applications on leadership computing facilities. The resulting prototype will be incorporated to large-scale file systems at DOE computing facilities hosted at LLNL. Dr. Yu is a tenured Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Florida State University (FSU). He served as a Research Staff Member at Oak Ridge National Lab until 2009, and then an assistant and associate professor at Auburn University until 2015. He is also credited as the creator of the Parallel Architecture and Systems Laboratory (PASL) at Auburn and FSU. Dr. Yu’s research interests include a multitude of technical areas including; data mining and analytics of big data and social networks, parallel computer systems and architecture, high speed interconnects, cloud computing, computational biology and climate modeling, and I/O systems. Once again, congratulations to Dr. Yu on his recent accomplishments. The development of more efficient distribution of burst buffers will do wonders in the field of large-scale file systems.",

The aim of this project is to develop an alternative execution model, namely, demand-driven execution of imperative programs. As Professor Whalley explained, “In our model, a program that is compiled from a contemporary language is executed in a demand-driven fashion in such a way that both instruction and data-level parallelism can be harvested through compiler-architecture collaboration.” The award includes funding for FSU in the amount of $315,000.

The objective of this project, titled “Active Learning for Computer Vision”, is to develop a semester-long curriculum on the emerging topic of active learning for computer vision applications. The rapid escalation of technology and the widespread emergence of modern technological equipment have resulted in the generation of large amounts of digital data (in the form of images, videos and text) in the modern era. This has expanded the possibilities of solving real-world problems using computational learning frameworks. However, annotating the data with class labels, to induce a machine learning model, is an expensive process in terms of time, labor and human expertise. This has set the stage for research in the field of active learning. Active learning algorithms automatically identify the salient and exemplar samples from large amounts of unlabeled data. This tremendously reduces human annotation effort, as only a few samples, which are identified by the algorithm, need to be labeled manually. Further, since the model gets trained on the most informative samples from the data population, it has better generalization capability than a standard passive learner. This project will produce a comprehensive survey of the existing work on active learning for vision applications, which can be used to educate students and next generation machine learning researchers in industry and academia on this important research challenge.",

The project is titled “NeTS: Small: Theory and Applications of Sparse Approximations of the Channel State Information in Wi-Fi Networks.” The focus of this project is to design efficient methods for measuring, compressing, and utilizing the Channel State Information (CSI) of Wi-Fi networks based on the discovery made by Prof. Zhang and his student Avishek Mukherjee that the CSI can be approximated very well by very few sinusoids in most Wi-Fi networks. As the CSI is the key to many operations, such as data modulation in MU-MIMO transmissions, this project will likely remove a major bottleneck in Wi-Fi networks and allow users to enjoy higher speed and better service.",

This project, titled “Facilitate Graph Computation by Graph Sparsification”, was awarded from the NSF directorate CISE:IIS:III. In the past decade, modern science and technology have witnessed an explosive growth of networked systems giving rise to a vast ocean of data with completely transformed scale, structure, and complexity, which, without loss of generality, are often modeled and interpreted as graphs. However, real-world graphs are voluminous and exhibit unprecedented complexity and challenges, rendering them extremely hard to manage, costly to ingest, and complicated to analyze. In this project, Prof. Zhao and his students will systematically investigate the principles, methodologies, and algorithms of graph sparsification. The objective of this project is to simplify large-scale graphs into structure-enriched, quality-preserving graph summaries moving toward facilitating and optimizing a wide range of graph-based computations in real-world big graphs.",

Dr. Kumar has been with the department since 2004 after joining as an assistant professor. He also held numerous visitations as a scientist throughout the United States and the UK in schools including MIT, Duke, and Oregon. He specializes in bridging the boundaries between algorithms and everyday life. His research revolves around taking computer theories and making them apply to real world practices. Designations like these continue to show the hard work our department puts into recruiting faculty dedicated to making a difference in their respective fields. As this distinction puts the department’s best face forward on a national level, we wish him nothing but the best on his travels.",

The NSF is the only federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering. NSF is no stranger to the department when it comes to funding research endeavors, and this designation comes with a funding package of $499,672 for the next 5 years. Professor Wang has been with the department since 2012, joining as an assistant professor where he also earned the First Year Professor Award. He earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from North Carolina State University before deciding coming to Florida State. Before that, he spent several years as a Senior Software engineer for Intel Asia-Pacific Research and Development, Ltd. His current research focuses on solving a serious issue involving trustworthy operating systems. Professor Wang seeks to develop a kernel-level security enclave for operating systems, and then use these isolated enclaves to design unique defense techniques against attacks. Also, this research could present avenues to prevent cold-boot attacks, which are security headaches for governments and corporations. Professor Wang’s work demonstrates the high level of the research our department is capable of producing and applying to real-world uses.

The program requires 30 credits and can be completed in three academic semesters. The program consists of – a common core of 18-credit course work, and four additional electives that define a concentration in one of the participating areas Admission Requirements The MS-IDS graduate program appeals directly to students with undergraduate degrees in math, computer science, or statistics, but will also attract students with less traditional backgrounds, e.g., physics or engineering.  Therefore, the admissions requirements are designed to select students with strong training in mathematics, statistics, and computer science that would be common across a range of undergraduate degrees. In addition to meeting all of the University and College admission requirements for graduate study, each applicant for the MS-IDS program must: –> The FSU IDS program is a self-pay program. In addition to meeting Florida State University and College of Arts and Sciences admission requirements for graduate study, each applicant for the FSU IDS program must: Have earned a Bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution and possess a minimal background consisting of Calculus 2 (MAC 2312 or equivalent), Introductory Statistics (STA 2023 or equivalent), and experience with an object-oriented programming language, preferably Python or R. Coursework in linear algebra is desirable, but not mandatory; Have a minimum of 3.0 GPA (B or better average) on the last 60 hours of undergraduate credits; and be in good standing at the institution of higher learning last attended; Provide a statement of intent and CV or résumé; and Provide three letters of recommendation discussing the student’s aptitude for graduate study A GRE score is not required for admission to the FSU IDS program for Fall 2021. Different majors and advanced electives may require additional prerequisites, which students will either have to demonstrate in their backgrounds or take additional coursework to satisfy. Additional information is available on the MS-IDS web site . Graduation Requirements The program requires at least 30 credits and 16 months to complete a course-based degree (3 academic semesters). The curriculum is designed with the expectation that the majority of students will graduate with a non-thesis course-based master’s degree. All students will complete a common set of core courses (18 credits) and a minimum of 12 credits of electives that define the specific chosen major. Although most students are expected to complete the course-based option, students will have the option to pursue completion of a thesis or project track by completing a qualified research project, taking additional credits for research and project/thesis defense. This track may require up to 6 additional credit hours. Interdisciplinary Data Science Core Coursework: This is a course-based Master’s degree program. All students will complete 30 credit hours consisting of 18 hours of core courses and 12 additional hours of coursework that define a specific major. 18 hours of core courses consist of: MAD 5XXX Mathematics for Data Science (3) COP 5XXX Introduction to Data Science (3) STA 5207 Applied Regression Methods (3) STA 5635 Machine Learning (3) CAP 5771 Data Mining (3) PHI 5XXX Data Ethics (2) XXX 5XXX Professional Development Seminar (1) Required Electives: The 12-hour additional coursework consists of four graduate courses and they are major-specific. For MS-IDS in Computer Science , the additional four courses are: CAP 5XXX Advanced Topics in Data Science (3) COP 5XXX Advanced Data Mining (3) Restricted Electives: One course in Cybersecurity chosen from the following, based on student background: CGS 5XXX Computer Security Fundamentals for Data Science (3) CIS 5370 Computer Security (3) One course from the following: CAP 5619 Deep and Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals (3) CAP 5605 Artificial Intelligence (3) CDA 5125 Parallel and Distributed Systems (3) CDA 5155 Computer Architectures (3) CNT 5505 Computer and Network Administration (3) COP 5570 Concurrent, Parallel and Distributed Programming (3) COP 5611 Advanced Operating Systems (3) COP 5725 Database Systems (3) COT 5405 Advanced Algorithms (3) ISC 5318 High-Performance Computing (3) Free Electives: None Detailed course description is available on the here .",

This is in response to the increasing need for high-performance disaster-tolerant networks that allow for the use of backup sites at a significant distance from the main site, thus ensuring a single disaster will not take down both sites. Included in this work are the development of fault-tolerant network protocols, quality of service issues, and reliability in end-to-end performance for the transfer of very large data sets. The corresponding infrastructure must be both cost-effective and robust.",

We are interested in the development of Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms; the applications of these algorithms in materials science, biochemistry, and physics; and the creation of computational infrastructure to support effective stochastic computing. We view Monte Carlo algorithms as any algorithms that use random number to compute quantities of interest. As such, we have developed extremely efficient Monte Carlo for problems ranging from the computation of permeabilities of packed beds to the electrostatic field elicited on large biomolecules in ionic solution. In addition, we study basic computational kernels, such as those involved in numerical linear algebra, to find effective Monte Carlo alternatives to existing, deterministic, algorithms. Finally, we have been involved in the development of computational infrastructure for stochastic computing. We developed the Scalable Parallel Random Number Generators (SPRNG) library that is very widely used in highly demanding Monte Carlo applications. SPRNG was an outgrowth of our own research in pseudo- and quasirandom number generation which continues in concert with SPRNG development. Also, building on SPRNG, we have developed extensive infrastructure for stochastic computing on the computational grid. In all these activities we have had undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral scholars, visitors, and international collaborators working with me in our research group.",

          "context": "Certificate | Certificate CNSS has discontinued the certificate program NSTISSI 4011 and CNSS4014 as of January 1, 2015. In April 2000, the NSA’s Information Assurance Directorate designated Florida State University as having met the training standards of the Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation . This process involved assessing the quality of FSU’s curriculum by a formal, rigorous training standard. FSU has, for the third time, renewed its certification to train specialists under the Committee of National Security Systems (CNSS) standards NSTISSI standard 4011 “Information Security Professionals”. As of August 2008, the university is also certified to offer the additional professional standard of CNSS 4014 for “Information Security Officers”. By achieving these designations, FSU students that complete the courses specified in the program are recognized as having been trained to serve as Information Systems Security Professionals or Information Systems Security Officers and receive a certificate that says the student “has satisfactorily completed an educational program certified by CNSS as compliant with NSTISSI No. 4011 or CNSS 4014 . ” This certificate is only available to degree-seeking undergraduate and graduate students at FSU that complete the core courses and their prerequisites. The certificate must be requested by the student in the same term of graduation as the student’s degree program. The requirements to meet the standards for the CNSSI-4014 (Security Officer) certificate are as follows: Undergraduate Level Graduate Level COP 4710 Theory and Structures of Databases COP 5725 Database Systems CIS 4360 Introduction to Computer Security CIS 5370 Computer Security CNT 4406 Network Security and Cryptography CNT 5412 Network Security, Active and Passive Defenses CNT 4504 Introduction to Computer Networks CNT 5505 Data and Computer Communications CNT 4603 Computer and Network System Administration CNT 5605 Computer and Network Administration COP 4610 Operating Systems and Concurrent Programming COP 5611 Advanced Operating Systems In order to obtain the additional certificate for completion of the NSTISSI-4011 (Security Professional) requirements, students must also take the following core courses: CDA 3101 Computer Organization COP 3330 Object-Oriented Programming 1.

This process involved assessing the quality of FSU’s curriculum by a formal, rigorous training standard. FSU has, for the third time, renewed its certification to train specialists under the Committee of National Security Systems  (CNSS) standards NSTISSI standard 4011 “Information Security Professionals”. As of August 2008, the university is also certified to offer the additional professional standard of CNSS 4014 for “Information Security Officers”.\nBy achieving these designations, FSU students that complete the courses specified in the program are recognized as having been trained to serve as Information Systems Security Professionals or Information Systems Security Officers and receive a certificate that says the student “has satisfactorily completed an educational program certified by CNSS as compliant with NSTISSI No. 4011 or CNSS 4014.”\nThis certificate is only available to degree-seeking undergraduate and graduate students at FSU that complete the core courses and their prerequisites. The certificate must be requested by the student in the same term of graduation as the student’s degree program.\nThe requirements to meet the standards for the CNSSI-4014 (Security Officer) certificate are as follows:\nUndergraduate Level\nGraduate Level\nCOP 4710  Theory and Structures of Databases\nCOP 5725  Database Systems\nCIS 4360  Introduction to Computer Security\nCIS 5370  Computer Security\nCNT 4406 Network Security and Cryptography\nCNT 5412 Network Security, Active and Passive Defenses\nCNT 4504 Introduction to Computer Networks\nCNT 5505 Data and Computer Communications\nCNT 4603 Computer and Network System Administration\nCNT 5605 Computer and Network Administration\nCOP 4610  Operating Systems and Concurrent Programming\nCOP 5611  Advanced Operating Systems\nIn order to obtain the additional certificate for completion of the NSTISSI-4011 (Security Professional) requirements, students must also take the following core courses:\nCDA 3101  Computer Organization\nCOP 3330 Object-Oriented Programming\n1.

Limitation or removal of any of these authorizations from individual GFS-faculty is delegated to the unit level authority where such assignments are made.\nGFS Nomination Criteria:The Faculty member under consideration for nomination to Graduate Faculty Status must, subject to consideration of special circumstances, have (1) completed the doctorate in Computer Science (or its equivalent) and (2) proven expertise in the teaching area.\nGFS Limitations/Restrictions: Faculty holding GFS are expected to actively engage in graduate education through teaching, mentoring and research supervision. They should show evidence of research-based scholarship and/or creative work resulting in peer reviewed publications or equivalent work. A Computer Science faculty member may be restricted from any GFS responsibilities (e.g. the right to serve as the chair for a dissertation committee) if two-thirds of the faculty in the department who hold that responsibility vote to restrict that faculty member’s specific responsibilities.\nFaculty not in the FSU Computer Science Department have the right to co-direct dissertations, theses, or projects provided that they have GFS in another FSU department or hold a courtesy faculty appointment in the FSU Computer Science Department with co-directive status. Such a faculty member may lose the right to co-direct Computer Science graduate students if two-thirds of the FSU Computer Science faculty with GFS vote to restrict it.\nSpecialized members of the Computer Science faculty and courtesy appointees may be nominated for Graduate Teaching Status (GTS) within the Computer Science Department. GTS allows a specialized faculty member or courtesy appointee to teach graduate courses. Persons in similar status may be nominated for Co-MDS and to be able to co-direct MS students on theses and projects. Non-tenure track faculty and courtesy appointees in the Computer Science Department are eligible for nomination to graduate teaching status (GTS) provided that they have received a PhD (or its equivalent), hold expertise in the teaching discipline, and have received a two-thirds majority vote in favor of appointment by the Computer Science faculty who currently have GFS or GTS within the department. Under exceptional circumstances specialized faculty members and courtesy appointees whose terminal academic degree is an MS, may be nominated for GTS to teach graduate courses within a specific area, on the basis of significant experience in that area and two-thirds of the Computer Science faculty with GFS or GTS vote to approve it. A Computer Science faculty member or courtesy appointee may lose individual GTS responsibilities (e.g. the right to teach graduate courses) if two-thirds of the faculty in the department who hold that responsibility vote to revoke it. All nominations must be approved by the Academic Dean and Dean of The Graduate School in accordance with university policy.\nSpecialized faculty members in the Computer Science Department are eligible for nomination to obtain masters directive status (MDS) to direct MS students on theses or projects provided that they have received a PhD (or its equivalent) and have received a two-thirds majority vote in favor of MDS by the Computer Science faculty who currently have GFS or MDS. Courtesy appointees in the Computer Science Department are eligible for nomination to obtain co-masters directive status (MDS) to direct MS students on theses or projects provided that they have received a PhD (or its equivalent) and have received a two-thirds majority vote in favor of CMDS by the Computer Science faculty who currently have GFS or MDS.\nApproved and adopted by two-thirds majority vote of the faculty holding GFS in June 2009.\nRevision of GTS policy approved by two-thirds majority vote of the faculty holding GFS/GTS in November 2012.\nRevision of GTS policy approved by two-thirds majority vote of the faculty holding GFS in April 2015.\n",

The graduate courses for the MS CC degree are listed below:\nCriminology Courses from Which MS CC Students Are Required to Take at Least Three:\nCCJ 5016 Crimes of the Powerful (3)\nCCJ 5285 Survey of Criminal Justice Theory and Research (3)\nCCJ 5606 Survey of Criminological Theories (3)\nCCJ 5607 History of Criminological Thought (3)\nCCJ 5636 Comparative Criminology and Criminal Justice (3)\nUp to date course descriptions for the above criminology courses can be found at: http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/p/academic-syllabi.php.\nComputer Science Courses Required for MS CC Students:\nCIS 5370 Computer Security (3)\nCNT 5412 Network Security, Active and Passive Defenses (3)\nCNT 5505 Data and Computer Communications (3)\nCNT 5605 Computer and Network Administration (3)\nCOP 5611 Advanced Operating Systems (3)\nCOP 5725 Database Systems (3)\nThe one additional criminology or CS course will be a graduate elective. The criminology courses can be taken in any order as none of these courses are prerequisites for any of the other courses. However, the 6 required graduate computer science courses each have undergraduate prerequisites that must be completed before the student will be allowed to take these courses.\n",

This new degree program was developed jointly by the Department of Computer Science and the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice.\nComputer crime can be broadly defined as any criminal activity that involves the use of information technology. These crimes include illegally accessing information, intercepting data, damaging or deleting data, interfering with the functioning of a computer system, identity theft, etc. Information-related crime and computer/network security issues are already major concerns. These issues affect all levels of business, government, and academia and have grown in importance as most organizations link their networked computer environments to the Internet. A Cyber Criminology student will learn both how to use computers to facilitate the study of crime and will study how crimes are accomplished through the use of computers.\nEmployment and Research Opportunities\nWe anticipate there will be a significant demand for graduates of the Cyber Criminology program. It is well known that there is a shortage of information technology experts. Similarly, there is a pressing need for information technology specialists to handle issues related to information crime, cyberforensics, and computer/network security. However, there is also a need for computer skills for the prevention, detection, and study of all types of crime, whether or not they involve the use of information technology. Graduates of the program will be prepared to work either for law enforcement agencies as information crime specialists, within companies or organizations as network security specialists, or within academia and government to study the causes of crime and the best methods for its prevention.\n",

We offer financial support to new and existing PhD and MS students in the form of teaching assistantship (TA), research assistantship (RA), and fellowship. Each semester, a number of (typically 25-35 in the Fall and 5-10 in the Spring) best qualifying new students, identified by the admissions and financial aids committee, are offered financial support with admission. \nThe department gives priority to students who were admitted with full financial support (20-hour TA/RA appointment or fellowship) and PhD students who were admitted without support, but have passed the PhD Preliminary exam. The general departmental policy is to continuously support such students in the Fall and Spring semesters (the department has very few TA positions in the summer) until they graduate, provided that sufficient funds are available. Typical duration of continuous support for Fall and Spring semesters is as follows.\n6 years for PhD students who entered the program without an MS degree in CS\n5 years for PhD students who entered the program with a CS MS degree\n2 years for MS students\nRequirements for continuous TA funding support for PhD students\nFor continuous TA support, PhD students have three levels of priorities: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3, with Tier 1 being the highest priority. As of Spring 2018, all students in all of the three levels of priorities are funded by the department (but this may change in the future). All students in any priority group for TA support must meet the following requirements: \nMaking minimum satisfactory progress toward the degree as specified in this document.\nSatisfying all university requirements for being a teaching assistant, including passing the English speaking test for foreign students.\nPerforming assigned duties (e.g TA/RA duties) satisfactorily and reliably.\nInforming the department in sufficient advance the desire to be supported and the commitment to the duties assigned by the department.\nA PhD Student who (1) was admitted with full financial support (20-hour TA/RA appointment or fellowship), or (2) was admitted without financial support, but has passed the PhD Preliminary exam, is in the Tier 3 priority group if the student meets the above requirements. \nA PhD student who meets the above requirements is in the Tier 2 priority group if the student is identified by a tenure-track faculty as a Tier 2 TA.\nA PhD student who meets the above requirements is in the Tier 1 priority group if the student is identified by a tenure-track faculty as a Tier 1 TA. \nThe department maintains the tier-3 list. Tenure-track faculty must identify their tier-1 and tier-2 TAs by July 1 for the Fall semester and October 15 for the Spring semester.\nRequirements for continuous TA funding support for MS students\nMS students admitted with financial support are defaulted to the Tier 1 priority group for the same level of support when admitted. As of Spring 2018, all students in the priority group are funded by the department. To remain in the top priority group, an MS student must\nMake minimum satisfactory progress toward the degree: maintaining a 3.0 GPA and completing the degree within 2 years.\nSatisfy all university requirements for being a teaching assistant, including passing the English speaking test for foreign students.\nPerform assigned duties (e.g TA/RA duties) satisfactorily and reliably.\nInform the department in sufficient advance the desire to be supported and the commitment to the duties assigned by the department.\nStatistics of Recent Graduate Student Financial Support\nFiscal Year\n Spring 2017 \n Spring 2018 \nNo. of MS Students\n 97 \n 98 \nNo. of PhD Students\n 65 \n 74 \nNo. of Students with Assistantships\n 114 \n 132 \n",

Below are the minimum admissions requirements for the Cybersecurity MS degree program:\nRequired Degrees: To be admitted to the Department of Computer Science as a CS graduate student you should have an undergraduate or graduate degree in Computer Science or related field from an accredited university. Students without an undergraduate degree in CS will be required to complete undergraduate prerequisites not on their undergraduate transcript before graduating with a graduate degree in CS. Students without a prior undergraduate or graduate degree in computer science should have completed COP4530 (Data Structures) or an equivalent class to be considered competitive for admissions. Here is the list of Undergraduate Prerequisites for the Cybersecurity MS Degree Program.\nGRE Scores:The minimum GRE scores required for admission are a 145 on the verbal section and a 150 on the quantitative section. For the old scoring system, the minimum GRE score required for admission is 1100 (Verbal and Quantitative combined) with a minimum of 650 on the Quantitative.\nTOEFL Scores: The minimum required score on the IBTOEFL for admission consideration is 80 (213 computer-based, 550 paper-based). However, the Computer Science Department considers a score of 100-105 competitive, especially when students are seeking assistantships. The ability to lecture in English will be a major consideration in the selection of students for Teaching Assistantships.\nGrade Point Average: Students should have at least a B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) average to be considered competitive. Students with a GPA of less than 3.0 in their undergraduate degree fall below both the department and university standards.\n",

Below are the minimum admissions requirements for the CNSA MS degree program:\nRequired Degrees: To be admitted to the Department of Computer Science as a CNSA graduate student, you should have an undergraduate or graduate degree in Computer Science or related field from an accredited university. If you are a current FSU student, the CNSA major is the option that was set up for BA in Computer Science and BS in Cyber Criminology undergraduates to matriculate towards. Students without an undergraduate degree in CS will be required to complete undergraduate prerequisites not on their undergraduate transcript before graduating with a graduate degree in CS. Students without a prior undergraduate or graduate degree in computer science should have completed COP4530 (Data Structures) or an equivalent class to be considered competitive for admissions. Here is the list of Undergraduate Prerequisites for the MS CNSA Degree Program.\nGRE Scores: The minimum GRE scores required for admission are a 145 on the verbal section and a 150 on the quantitative section. For the old scoring system, the minimum GRE score required for admission is 1100 (Verbal and Quantitative combined) with a minimum of 650 on the Quantitative.\nTOEFL Scores: The minimum required score on the IBTOEFL for admission consideration is 80 (213 computer-based, 550 paper-based). However, the Computer Science Department considers a score of 100-105 competitive, especially when students are seeking assistantships. The ability to lecture in English will be a major consideration in the selection of students for Teaching Assistantships.\nGrade Point Average:  Students should have at least a B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) average to be considered competitive. Students with a GPA of less than 3.0 in their undergraduate degree fall below both the department and university standards.\n",

Students without a prior undergraduate or graduate degree in computer science should have at least completed COP4530 (Data Structures) or an equivalent class to be considered competitive for admissions. Here is the list of Undergraduate Prerequisites for the MS CC Degree Program.\nGRE Scores: The minimum GRE scores required for admission are a 145 on the verbal section and a 150 on the quantitative section. For the old scoring system, the minimum GRE score required for admission is 1100 (Verbal and Quantitative combined) with a minimum of 650 on the Quantitative.\nTOEFL Scores: The minimum required score on the IBTOEFL for admission consideration is 80 (213 computer-based, 550 paper-based). However, the Computer Science Department considers a score of 100-105 competitive, especially when students are seeking assistantships. The ability to lecture in English will be a major consideration in the selection of students for Teaching Assistantships.\nGrade Point Average: Students should have at least a B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) average to be considered competitive. Students with a GPA of less than 3.0 in their undergraduate degree fall below both the department and university standards.\n",

The activities of the FSU Vision Group focus on research in computer vision that are motivated by psychophysical data and neurophysiological findings. We emphasize that visual modeling is a fundamental problem in computer vision in that visual perception is nonlinear, which makes many of the tools critical for linear systems not applicable. We focus on models which may have great potentials for real-world problems. Research activities at Florida State Vision group are centered around visual information processing from human visual perception modeling, computational models and algorithms for perception problems, to real world applications. Visual information processing is a very complex phenomenon that is involved with prior knowledge stored in memory, modeling of the visual environment, and computation at a given moment of deriving a solution for the purpose of survival and decision making.\n",

Because the systems field constantly sprouts new research domains with independent evolutions, it is crucial to develop solutions that resolve incompatible assumptions and requirements among multiple domains. His recent work, the Conquest file system, illustrates how performance improvement does not preclude system simplicity. His continuing work, Conquest-2, aims to conserve energy while improving performance at the same time. Andy is also the inventor of electric-field-based multipath routing for mobile ad hoc networks, which demonstrates how large-scale distributed coordination can be achieved without communication and maintaining states. Previously, Wang was involved in analyzing the performance of optimistic peer replication through his parallel simulation framework.\n",

We are interested in the development of Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms; the applications of these algorithms in materials science, biochemistry, and physics; and the creation of computational infrastructure to support effective stochastic computing. We view Monte Carlo algorithms as any algorithms that use random number to compute quantities of interest. As such, we have developed extremely efficient Monte Carlo for problems ranging from the computation of permeabilities of packed beds to the electrostatic field elicited on large biomolecules in ionic solution. In addition, we study basic computational kernels, such as those involved in numerical linear algebra, to find effective Monte Carlo alternatives to existing, deterministic, algorithms. Finally, we have been involved in the development of computational infrastructure for stochastic computing. We developed the Scalable Parallel Random Number Generators (SPRNG) library that is very widely used in highly demanding Monte Carlo applications. SPRNG was an outgrowth of our own research in pseudo- and quasirandom number generation which continues in concert with SPRNG development. Also, building on SPRNG, we have developed extensive infrastructure for stochastic computing on the computational grid. In all these activities we have had undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral scholars, visitors, and international collaborators working with me in our research group.\n",

His main research interests lie in applying the rich theory of algorithms to the domains of computational geometry, computer graphics, pattern recognition, and machine learning. The general theme that threads his research interests in algorithms is narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Theoretical computer science relies on making assumptions that do not generally hold in the real world. For instance, the performance of algorithms on real data vs worst case analysis, the assumption that all memory operations are unit cost, noise in the input, degeneracies, importance of exact solution to optimization problems are issues that seem to need attention but are mostly ignored by the theory community. Addressing some of these issues has been the focus of his research. His work on core sets illustrates why column generation methods perform well in optimization, both theoretically and experimentally. His work on surface and curve reconstruction gave very simple algorithms that were provably fast and could handle noise in the data. His research on cache oblivious algorithms showed why certain ways to analyze algorithms compared to the RAM model of analysis were better for practical purposes. He also worked on the design of a classifier for biometric and other applications. This classifier has also been used for palm identification using outlines of the human hand. The classifier was based upon ideas that came out from his research in optimization.\n",

          "context": "Summer Teaching Policy | Computer Science\n\nSummer Teaching Policy\nWho is Paid to Teach in the Summer?\nThe department typically is allocated a very small budget for summer faculty salaries. This allows the department to hire a few 9-month faculty members to teach courses during the summer. The amount allocated to the department is typically enough to cover about three courses. Faculty paid from this budget only for instruction, not for research.\nAccording to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the total amount paid for a faculty member to teach a given course in the summer must be the same as the amount paid for teaching the same course during the academic year. This means that a course that would normally be a 25% duty assignment in the academic year is a 37.5% duty assignment if for the A term, and a 76.2% duty assignment if for the B or C term.\nThe policy of the department is that before the schedule of classes is made for a given summer the Department Chair polls the faculty (by paper memo or e-mail) to find out:\nWho would like to teach a regular course for the summer, and what courses they are willing to teach?The department is normally interested only funding 9-month faculty to teach graduate courses. Non-tenure-track faculty, who are on 12-month appointments and so required to teach summers, generally cover the undergraduate courses, along with teaching assistants and adjuncts. Only graduate faculty members may teach graduate courses, and most graduate faculty are 9-month faculty.\nThe Department Chair chooses from those responding to this question a few (generally two or three, depending on budget) faculty members to teach graduate courses for the summer. If the budget is insufficient to satisfy all requests for summer teaching, priority is given to those who have not been paid to teach a regular summer course recently, based on a round-robin list. Whenever a person teaches a regular summer course that\nperson is placed at the tail of the list, so those who have not taught recently are ahead in the line for summer teaching of those who have been paid to teach a regular summer course recently.\nSince anyone can remember, the number of requests has always been less than or equal to the number that could be funded, so no such prioritization has been necessary.\nWho plans to supervise graduate students on DIS, supervised research, thesis, or dissertation during the summer, and who are the students they plan to supervise?The Department Chair funds as many of these faculty members as possible, each for a small FTE, to allow them to be instructor of record for individual instruction courses for the summer without violating the policy of the Dean of the Faculties described further below. The amount of the appointment is symbolic, and varies according to the number of faculty interested and the amount of funds available. It is typically just a few percent.\nAs with all instructional appointments, faculty on such appointments are expected to be mostly in town during the period they are appointed, so that they are available to supervise the students in their individual instruction courses.\nWho is Allowed to Sign as Instructor of Record for\nIndividual Instruction Courses?\nThere is a policy (due to the Dean of the Faculties) that only individuals who have an instructional appointment (i.e., are on the payroll for the summer with a non-zero percentage of instructional assignment) may be listed as instructor of record for a course.\nThe occasion when some faculty members run afoul of this policy is when they have students who are working on a thesis or dissertation during the summer, and what to sign up for thesis or dissertation hours, but the faculty member cannot be instructor or record because the faculty member is not on the department’s teaching payroll for the summer. The department’s summer teaching allocation policy (see above) is intended to solve this problem primarily by giving a small percent FTE summer appointment to each faculty member who expects to have individual study students enrolled for the summer.\nThe one exception to the policy is that a faculty member who is on FSU’s payroll to do sponsored research may sign as instructor of record for (only) DIS, supervised research, thesis, or dissertation if the student is getting credit for doing work on the sponsored research project (whether or not the student is paid for the work).\nWhether on a grant or an instructional appointment, the appointment period of the instructor of record for a course must cover the full term during which the student is registered.\nWhere a student needs to register for thesis or dissertation and the regular thesis or dissertation advisor is not eligible to be instructor of record, it is recommended that the instructor of record be another member of the student’s supervisory committee, or the department chair.\nNote that there is a clear principle behind this policy, which every faculty member would support, i.e. that we do not teach for free. This principle is one that is important to maintain, lest some day we be required to teach in the summers without any additional compensation.\nCopyright © 2015\nFlorida State University Computer Science Department\n",

          "context": "Graduate FAQ | Computer Science\n\nGraduate FAQ\nAPPLICATION QUESTIONS\n1. Are paper recommendation letters accepted?\nNo. All recommendation letters must be submitted online through the application system. Information on completing the online recommendation forms will be sent directly to those listed by the applicant.\n2. Are photocopies or faxes of transcripts accepted?\nNo. An official transcript from each institution attended by the applicant must be sent directly to the Florida State University Admissions Office. That address is:\nOffice of Graduate Admissions\nFlorida State University\n314 Westcott Bldg.\nTallahassee, FL. 32306-1410\nUSAPhone: (850) 644-3501\nFSU Graduate Admissions e-mail:graduateadmissions@admin.fsu.edu\nURL: http://admissions.fsu.edu/\n3. My TOEFL and/or GRE score(s) is/are below the department standards. Will I be automatically denied? Should I apply?\nAll complete applications are submitted to the Admissions Committee for review. If you do not meet the department standard, it is less likely that you will be recommended for admission, particularly if you fall below the university requirement of an overall score of 80 (IB-TOEFL) and 145 Verbal & 150 Quantitative on the GRE.\n4. I took the GRE more than once. Which score do you accept: the highest or the most recent score?\nFSU will take the highest combined scores from all attempts of the GRE which we call the “Super Score”. For example if you got 142 verbal and 160 quantitative on your first  attempt and 146 verbal and 157 quantitative on your second attempt, the Super Score would be 146 verbal and 160 quantitative.\n5. How long should my statement of purpose be?\nStatements of purpose are usually between one and three pages in length.\n6. What should I include in my statement of purpose?\nA statement of purpose should provide details that cannot be obtained from the transcript or résumé.  You should state the interests and reason(s) for wanting to attend Florida State  University.  You should also provide an idea of possible research areas that you may want to pursue while in our graduate program and what experience you’ve had in these areas so far.\nResume/Curriculum Vitae\n1. What should this document contain?\nList any academic honor\nList any computer related course work and/or experience and all the programming languages that you know.\nList any teaching experience\nFor international students, please describe your training and experience with English\nGRE QUESTIONS\n1. Is the GRE required for admission to the University? Can it be waived?\nThe University requires test scores from a nationally standardized graduate admission test. The Department requires the General GRE test. This requirement cannot be waived.\n2. Can I send you a certified copy of my GRE score so you can make a decision and I will follow up with an “Official” score later?\nWe can only accept official test scores for the purpose of evaluating your application. A GRE score is considered official when it is sent directly from the testing center to the university Office of Admissions. No other method is acceptable. This requirement cannot be waived.\n3. Do you count the Analytical portion of the test?\nSome of our faculties do look at all the scores but the total GRE score is based only upon the Verbal and Quantitative portion. The minimum scores are 145 verbal and 150 quantitative.\n4. If I score less than the posted minimums, can I be accepted?\nA minimum score does not assure a candidate of acceptance. Most of our admitted students are well above the posted minimums, but applications are reviewed for a sense of overall preparedness to potentially be successful in our graduate programs.  GRE scores are not the only factor that play into determining whether a student will be admitted, but they are a useful tool to help provide a basis of comparison between students that are coming from a variety of different colleges and university from many cultures and countries around the world.\n5. Do you require the Computer Science Specific GRE test?\nNo.\n6. I have not taken the GRE test yet. Can I still go ahead and apply?\nYes you can. However, your application will not be reviewed until complete.\n7. The undergraduate GPA requirement for the graduate school is 3.0. If I score very good on the GRE would that offset a poor GPA?\nNot really. Your entire folder is evaluated by our Admission and Financial Aid Committee. A strong showing in one area does not necessarily offset a weak showing in another.\nTOEFL (Test Of English as a Foreign Language) QUESTIONS\n1. I did not score high on the TOEFL test, can I still be admitted?\nThe minimum score required by the University on the TOEFL test is 550 for the paper-based and 80 for internet-based. Falling below the minimums is an automatic denial without exception. The Department standards are significantly higher than the University requirements.\n2. What is the average TOEFL test score?\nThe average test is over 610 for the paper based and over 95 for the internet-based version. We have found that students who score below 600 paper-based or 95 internet-based on the TOEFL test do not typically do well in our courses because of the lack of communication ability.\n3. My English is very good and I have lived in the United States since I was young. Do I need the TOEFL?\nIf you are permanent resident, no. However, if you require a visa in order to stay in the country and you have not obtained a bachelor’s degree from the United States or another English speaking country, you need the TOEFL.\nGRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIP QUESTIONS\n1. I’m interested in an assistantship through the department. What additional forms do I need to fill out?\nAll Computer Science graduate applicants will be considered for an assistantship through the department, unless otherwise sponsored by a third party (e.g. Military, Government of Origin). For international students required to take the TOEFL exam, a score of 620 (Paper-Based) or 100 (Internet-Based) or 250 (Computer-Based) is necessary to be considered for an assistantship through the department.\n2. What is the criteria for getting a Teaching Assistantship?\nThis is a very difficult question. The Department uses Teaching Assistantships in various ways. (1) To attract highly qualified PhD students to our Department. They are given teaching assistantships in the assumption that they will eventually become research assistants. (2) To attract masters students with exceptional teaching ability to support the large number of lower level classes in computer science and computer literacy.\nBasically we look at all of the following criteria:\nQuality and ranking of the schools attended\nGPA\nGRE Scores\nTOEFL Scores (if applicable)\nTeaching experience\nPrevious degree program\nQuality of research or research potential\nQuality of letters of recommendation\nAn overall assessment of whether the student is serious about the degree program\n3. I understand that if you apply to the PhD program, you stand a better chance of getting an assistantship. Is this true?\nNo. Students should apply for the degree program that they intend to complete. TAs must have exceptional public speaking abilities and a solid academic background. Many of these students are MS degree-seeking students.\n",

Graduate students in the Department of Computer Science are generally supported by the following means:\nTeaching Assistantships: The department employs a large number of teaching assistants. Recipients are selected by a faculty committee from the general application pool. In addition to academic qualifications, the committee considers attributes that are likely to affect an individual’s ability to teach, including spoken English fluency. Prior teaching experience is valuable but is not a requirement.\nResearch Assistantships: Faculty members within the department have a number of research grants and contracts that support graduate student assistants. The hiring decisions are made by the individual faculty members who are the principal investigators of the various contracts and grants. Interested students might look at the Department of Computer Science web page listing current research grants, and contact individual faculty members directly.\nDepartment Sponsored Federal Scholarships: Many domestic students are supported by the FSU CS Cybersecurity Scholarship for Services Program\nFellowships: Some students are supported by Department or University Scholarships and Fellowships\nOther Jobs: Students also find jobs outside the department, on or off campus.\nHow to Apply for Financial Aid\nTo apply for a fellowship or assistantship, a student only needs to complete the Application for Admission. All Computer Science graduate applicants will be considered for an assistantship through the department, unless otherwise sponsored by a third party (e.g. Military, Government of Origin). For those international students required to take the TOEFL exam, a score of 620 (Paper Based) or 105 (Internet Based) or 250 (Computer Based) is necessary to be considered for an assistantship through the department.\nTuition & Fee Waivers\nStudents on fellowships or graduate assistantships generally receive a partial waiver of tuition (excluding fees), in addition to a generous stipend.\nStudents who are US residents from states other than Florida should apply for Florida residency as soon as possible, in order to qualify for in-state tuition.

A.\tAcademic advisors can lift map term off track and D/F holds. i.\tMap Term Off Track & D/F Warning Holds: Please schedule an appointment or attend drop-in advising. ii.\tD/F Dismissal holds: Please change your major before emailing advisor@cs.fsu.edu to lift this hold. B.\tFor all other holds, click on the hold and read the details for instructions and contact information. For any questions, contact the department listed on the hold. 2.\tI have a graduation progress check hold but am not graduating. Can an advisor lift it? A.\tAdvisors cannot lift these holds. Graduation Progress Check holds are just that—a check to see where you are in terms of graduating and to see what you have left to graduate. It does not mean you are graduating right now. B.\tClick on the hold and follow the directions to remove it. Note that both the Registrar and College of Arts and Sciences put holds on student accounts for Graduation Progress Checks, so make sure to complete both to remove the holds. Enrolling/Schedule Planning: 1.\tCan I take this class pass/fail (S/U)? A.\tGenerally, CS majors will only take their foreign language courses as S/U. No major, minor, or Liberal Studies requirement courses may be taken S/U. B.\tSubmit the request online in Student Central by the 7th-week deadline. See instructions here: https://registrar.fsu.edu/training/su_grade_request . 2.\tI am trying to enroll in an online CS course but received an error message. Can an advisor enroll me? A.\tCS Majors may not take CS Distance Learning courses. These courses are reserved for the Distance Learning program. Fall 2020 CS courses will have the “location” listed as “remote.” CS major courses with a “location” of “online” are reserved for Distance Learning. 3.\tMy registration opened. Can an advisor tell me what to take? A.\tYour academic advisor will be happy to advise you on course options if you attend drop-in advising or schedule an appointment. B.\tTo get started, however, students can also check these resources: i. My Academic Requirements ii. CS Major Flowcharts iii. Academic Program Guide 4.\t(Upper-division students) I want to graduate soon. Can my advisor tell me what I have left to take? A.\tSure! First, refer to your College of Arts and Sciences Progress Check (pick it up from 010 Longmire or email as-progresscheck@fsu.edu ) and your major’s flowchart. Then, see an advisor. 5.\tCan you tell me what CS electives are offered and when? A.\tCS electives change every semester, so we email out the list to the majors listserv after the schedule posts each semester (February and October). Check your email or contact advisor@cs.fsu.edu. 6.\tHow can I drop a course from this semester? A.\tCourses can be dropped without grade liability until the 7th-week deadline. Courses can be (“late”) dropped with a W until the 12th-week deadline. Upper-division students are allowed ONE (1) late drop at FSU. Deadlines are posted on the Registrar’s Academic Calendar each semester. First, double-check with FSU Financial Aid. Then, watch this video for instructions. 7.\tHow can I sign up for the Foreign Language placement test? A.\tSign up here: https://www.registerblast.com/fsu/Exam/List B.\tMore information on Foreign Language Exemption & Placement: https://www.modlang.fsu.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/exemption-placement Graduation 1.\tI didn’t apply for graduation but am supposed to graduate this semester! How can I do that? A.\tSee the upper division advisor for a Graduation Clearance form, then contact the College of Arts & Sciences at as-advising@fsu.edu to ask to be late-added to the graduation list. 2.\tI applied for graduation. What am I supposed to do now? A.\tGo through the Graduation Checklist on the Registrar’s page: http://registrar.fsu.edu/graduation/checklist/ .

          "context": "University, College & Department Rules | University, College & Department Rules University & College Rules Please see the FSU Graduate Bulletin (hard copy or on-line) for more details. The following are rules that apply from the college &/or university: Students in the thesis master’s program or PhD program must register for thesis/dissertation credits each term in which a substantial amount of work is being done on the the thesis/dissertation, even if the minimum of six (6) semester hours of thesis, or 24 semester hours of dissertation, has already been met. Students who have completed the required course work and who continue to use campus facilities and/or receive faculty supervision but who have not made a final thesis/dissertation submission shall include in the required full-time load two (2) hours of thesis/dissertation. Students who have left the campus must register for at least two (2) semester hours of thesis or dissertation credit per term as long as they are receiving faculty supervision. Students must register for at least one (2) semester hours of thesis or dissertation credit in the final term in which a degree is granted even if ALL the requirements for the degree have been completed in previous semesters. This is to cover the costs of manuscript clearance and final degree clearance. Any work with the major professor, committee members or use of university facilities would require registration for two (2) hours of thesis or dissertation. Twelve (12) semester hours per semester constitutes a full-time load for graduate students and fellowship holders in the university. However, nine (9) semester hours is considered a full-time load in the Computer Science department for international students and students with an assistantship. International students must obtain the corresponding form from International Studies to be signed to verify this. The maximum number of hours which a graduate student may carry without special permission is fifteen (15). A heavier load requires approval by the dean. Students who have been out of school (i.e. not registered for) two or more consecutive semesters (including summer) must submit an application for readmission to the readmissions section of the Office of the University Registrar. This application must be submitted at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the term for which readmission is desired. International students are required to be full-time students fall and spring semesters but not during summer unless summer is the first semester for which they are on campus. The major professor of a doctoral student in candidacy must submit a PhD progress report each year. This can be done via the department by completing this on-line document and submitting it to the CS Director of Graduate Studies. This is completed in January of each year. Once admitted to candidacy, a “Doctoral Supervisory Committee” form and a “Admission to Candidacy” form must be completed and filed with the department Graduate Coordinator. Such forms are available from the Graduate Coordinator or Director of Graduate Studies. A doctoral student must be admitted to candidacy at least six (6) months prior to the granting of the degree. The Office of Graduate Studies requires notification of thesis/dissertation defense two weeks prior to the defense. It further requires that a doctoral student submit a completed copy of the dissertation to the doctoral committee at least four (4) weeks prior to the defense. See GradSpace on Canvas for deadlines. An electronic version of a completed thesis or dissertation must be submitted to the university. During the first two weeks of the term in which a candidate expects to receive a degree, application should be made for a diploma at the office of the University Registrar. If a candidate previously filed for a diploma but did not receive the degree, the application must be repeated. Additional Department Rules The department extends the University policy about thesis/dissertation hours to include students who are working on a master’s project. Thus, a student who is using University resources or receiving faculty supervision is required to register for at least two (2) hours of project even if the course requirements are complete. Each graduate student is required to meet with his or her advisor at least once per semester. The department advising form is to be completed at each such meeting and should be returned to the Graduate Coordinator in 203 Love. The forms will remain in the student’s file until graduation and will be used as part of the graduation check. Advisors and students are advised to keep copies for their records. A graduate student is automatically dropped from the graduate program after three or more U’s in any graduate course. The department has a guideline that a student will only receive a S (satisfactory) for a CGS5xxx course for an undergraduate prerequisite when the student achieves a B- or better in the equivalent undergraduate course. Many fellowships have load requirements that are higher than our departmental requirements. In such cases, the fellowship rules supersede those of the department. It is the responsibility of the major professor of the student doing a project, thesis, or dissertation to submit to the director of graduate studies the names of the major professor and committee members as soon as such committee has been formed. This is necessary before signing up for project, thesis, or dissertation hours. Masters students doing the thesis or project option are usually restricted from taking Directed Independent Study courses CIS 5900 and CIS 6900. Rather, such students should take thesis or project hours, respectively. A student defending a project, thesis, dissertation or area paper is required to inform the graduate coordinator of the title and date, time and location of the defense at least two (2) weeks prior to the defense. It is not required by the department that the chair of Computer Science sign the signature page of the thesis or dissertation. Upon completion of a thesis, project or dissertation, a student must submit an electronic copy of such to the CS department webmaster. Additionally, theses and dissertations must be electronically submitted to the university. Graduate studies should be engaged as a full-time endeavor. Students who are supported on a qualifying assistantship are expected to be fully engaged with their studies. Additional employment or activity, especially outside the Program is discouraged to ensure timely completion of one’s degree. Requests for additional or outside, employment or activity will be evaluated for conflicts of interest in accordance with the CBA. A PhD CS student cannot be admitted to the MS degree program if they already have a MS in Computer Science or MS in Computer Engineering from another institution. Note that a student must be admitted to the MS program before they can obtain an MS degree. Priority for continued departmental support will be given to students who are in good academic standing and are making timely progress towards completion of their degree. A graduate student who has completed all of the requirements for the degree can take additional courses, but will not be eligible for departmental support. Lower priority for support may be given to: (1) MS students who have been in the MS program for 2 full years; (2) PhD students with an MS from another institution who have (a) not passed the qualifying exam after 2 years, (b) not passed the qualifying and preliminary exams after 3 years, and (c) not completed the degree after 5 years; (3) PhD students starting with the BS or completed the MS at FSU who have (a) not passed the qualifying exam after 3 years, (b) not passed the qualifying and preliminary exams after 4 years, and (c) not completed the degree after 6 years. ALL graduate students must complete an Exit Survey before graduation. The minimum satisfactory progress of a CS PhD student is given at the following link: PhD Progress Milestones",

Charter: The purpose of the Graduate Curriculum Committee is to act as the executive body of the department in matters relating to the graduate curriculum, its degree programs and courses. The committee will proactively evaluate the graduate curriculum, implement necessary changes and minor improvements, propose significant improvements for faculty decision, and respond to faculty, administration, staff and student issues on matters within its scope. The authority and decision making ability of this committee is derived from the Chair of the department. The committee is responsible for oversight of the graduate curriculum, including approval of new course proposals, modifications to existing courses and textbook choices for all graduate courses. The committee is also responsible for proposing changes to degree program requirements and for new graduate degree and certificate programs to be approved by the faculty. Organization: The committee will be comprised of members of the faculty and staff of the Department of Computer Science. The Chair of the Department will appoint members to the committee and assign a Chair. Committee members will solicit and gather issues for discussion from faculty, staff and students and call meetings on an “as-needed” basis. Minutes will be kept and recommendations made to the Chair of the Department in writing. All proposed curriculum changes, other than those that are truly minor, shall be published to the Computer Science Faculty for consideration, discussion, and voting at a CS faculty meeting. Minority reports may be attached to committee proposals by any member of the committee. Member Responsibilities: Committee Chair: The Department Chair will appoint The Chair of the Committee. The Committee chair shall call meetings, assign individuals to sub-committees, and establish procedures and guidelines for the assessment of individual topics assigned to the subcommittees. Committee Members: Each person assigned as a member of the committee shall participate in meetings called by the Chair of the Committee. It is the responsibility of each member to make recommendations to the committee on potential curriculum modifications and to keep abreast of current computer science and university curricula. Each committee member shall have voting rights on items of debate during committee meetings. Each committee member shall be afforded an equal opportunity to discuss matters during regular committee meetings. A majority vote of all members of the committee is required on all actions recommended for adoption by the department, except that 2/3 supermajority of all members of the committee is required to modify this Organization and Charter document. Policy Generation: In order to foster respect for the proposals generated by this committee, the following procedural guidelines will be followed: The committee will maintain a well publicized method via which members of the department may make requests and recommendations regarding curriculum changes. Specifically, a textbook change request form will be provided on the department web site. Faculty may send email to the chair of the committee with suggestions for curriculum changes. Committee meeting times and locations will be announced to the faculty and advising staff via email well in advance of such meetings and attendance is open to all. Prior to the formal submission of proposed significant changes to the Chair and faculty for consideration, the committee will publish to the faculty and advising staff, in a regular and well publicized manner, a draft proposal or proposals. The committee shall then allow a minimum of 10 working days for consideration and comment. Thereafter, a further meeting shall be held to discuss the concerns of the Computer Science community and, if possible, a final vote taken. Coincident with the submission (in writing) of formal proposals (and any minority reports) to the Chair and faculty for consideration, the formal proposal shall be published to the advising staff and student ACM representative for consideration and comment. Other Committee Duties and Responsibilities: Apart from addressing ongoing concerns brought up by the Department Chair and faculty regarding the graduate curriculum, the committee shall also have routine responsibilities as described below: Yearly Review: Each year, the committee will meet within the first 30 days of the fall term and review the current state of the graduate curriculum, with a a focus on currency of the program within the context of the ever-changing field of computer science. Discussion of any proposed curriculum changes by the committee itself and of faculty suggestions of which committee members are aware will also be brought forward at this time.",

Students who have left the campus must register for at least two (2) semester hours of thesis or dissertation credit per term “so long as they are receiving faculty supervision.” [page 72 of the Graduate Bulletin] “Returning students who … have been out of school for two or more consecutive terms (including the summer term) must submit an application for readmission to the readmissions section of the Office of the University Registrar. This application must be submitted at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the term for which readmission is desired.” [ Graduate Bulletin ] Any international student on a visa who still claims to be a student is required by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service to be a full time student except on their last semester, and they can only have one last semester. “Twelve (12) semester hours per semester constitutes a full-time load for graduate students and fellowship holders. A student who wishes to register for fewer than twelve (12) semester hours must have written approval from the academic dean prior to registration.” [ Graduate Bulletin ] “Nine (9) semester hours is defined as a full-time load for graduate assistantship holders on a quarter-time appointment or larger. Academic deans may grant exceptions to this policy for teaching assistants in those departments which conform to national course load policies in their disciplines. To satisfy the residence requirement, however, a doctoral student must be enrolled for twenty-four (24) semester hours during any period of 12 consecutive months.” [ Graduate Bulletin ] “The [maximum] number of hours which a graduate student may carry without special permission is fifteen (15). A heavier load may be permitted by the academic dean.” [ Graduate Bulletin ] “Students must register for at least one (1) semester hour of thesis or dissertation credit in the final term in which a degree is granted. Nonthesis-type master’s program students who have not previously registered for the comprehensive examination must do so the final term.” [ Graduate Bulletin ] “To be eligible for Matriculation and Out of State waivers this summer, TAs and RAs must carry the following minimum course loads during the terms indicated: 13-week Session A 9 hours 6-week Sessions B or C (must be appointed for .50 FTE) 5 hours Combination of A & B or A & C terms 9 hours ” [Memo from the Dean of Arts & Sciences, 8 March 2002] Additional Departmental Rules The Department of Computer Science imposes the following additional student course load requirements. Since Summer 1997, the department checks registrations of graduate students, and cancels them if they do not meet the department’s requirements. The department extends the University policy about thesis/dissertation hours to include students who are working on a master’s project. That is, a student who is using University resources or taking up the time of a faculty member is required to register for at least 2 hours of thesis, dissertation, project, or DIS. The department formally recognizes only three categories of registration: Full Time, Part Time, and FEOTABD (means “Fully Employed, Out of Town, and All But Document”, see definitions below). In short, only full-time students are entitled to any of the following departmental resources: Space allocation of any kind Telephone service Workstation (dedicated or shared) Printing service Copy service Access to departmental expense funds, for example to support travel Partial relaxation of this policy (items 1, 2, 3 on an as-available basis and items 4, 5 only for research-related material) may occur in summer, as long as the resources are otherwise unused, and for FEOTABD PhD students returning to finish a dissertation. The three categories, the required loads of students, and the privileges of students in each category are explained in more detail below. The Categories Full Time This category consists of all graduate students who are not in either of the other two categories. All TAs and RAs are in this category. Part Time This category consists of graduate students who have been formally admitted to part time status. The admitting paperwork must reside in the student’s advising folder. To be admitted to part time status, the student must submit a memorandum to the department chair, in writing or email, containing the following items : A request to be admitted to Part Time status A statement that the applicant is employed full time as a computer professional The name of the employing entity and location The employment supervisor’s name, address and phone number FEOTABD This category, “Fully Employed, Out of Town, and All But Document”, consists of graduate students who meet ALL of the following criteria: All requirements for the degree have been completed, except for the defense of the document (Dissertation, Thesis, or Project) No on-campus services will be used, except for interaction with university personnel on the day (or two) of the defense Computing facilities may be accessed remotely, but no on-campus services such as printing, library, major professor office or other space use, etc, are expected to be used. The Requirements Full Time students must register for nine (9) hours of graduate computer science credits each Fall and Spring semester and five (5) hours each summer semester in which they are using FSU facilities. Part Time students must register for three (3) hours of graduate computer science credits each semester in which they are using FSU facilities. FEOTABD students must register for one (1) hour of Dissertation, Thesis, or Project every semester. One Exception In the last semester, a student may register for as little as two hours. Note, however, that a student may have only one last semester . In the event that the student invokes this exception one semester and does not complete that semester, it cannot be repeated the following semester. Fellows Many fellowships have load requirements that are higher than our departmental requirements. In such cases, the fellowship rules supersede those of the department. Special Rules for Summer Only If you are not on assistantship/fellowship, then If you are not using ANY university resources (including access to faculty), then you are not required to register at all. Most people who are in the middle of a thesis, project, or dissertation are not likely to be in this category since you will be continuing your contact with your major professor. If you are using some type of resources, then you need to register for something. If working on a thesis or dissertation, you should register for at least 2 hrs of thesis/diss. If working on a project, you should register for at least one hour of project. If not doing any of the above, you should register for something (e.g., a class or maybe a DIS). This could be as little as 1 hr. In particular, this means it is OK if you want to just sign up for one course this summer (if not on waivers). Remember that if it’s your last term, it is OK to register for as little as 1 hr (1 hr of thesis, diss, or project) … plus only whatever else you need to graduate. If you have any questions about this, please contact the Director of Graduate Studies.",

In judging whether these three deliverables demonstrate adequate mastery, the supervisory committee shall consider whether the depth of technical knowledge and level of skill demonstrated by the student are consistent with the expectations for professional employment. The scope and difficulty of the project should be greater than that of a term paper for a course. The technical depth should be appropriate for the capstone of a graduate degree. In particular, it should require study of one or more areas of computer science beyond what is covered by the required graduate and undergraduate courses. The software may be an end product or be incidental to a piece of experimental research (e.g. a simulator, or implementation of an algorithm for performance testing). The originality need not be fundamental. Creativity at a fundamental level, such as in the design of algorithms and data structures, or in the concept of the application, is desirable but not required. It is acceptable to produce “yet another” implementation of a type of software that has been done before. However, in the latter case it is essential that the student first do a study of prior work and document that study with references and analysis, showing how the new implementation incorporates lessons learned from prior practice. The project document shall always include a description of the project adequate to inform the committee members of the motivation, objectives, scope, methods, and results. It shall ordinarily cover the full software development cycle, including requirements analysis, software design, test design, validation testing, and performance analysis. This project description shall have the form of a technical report. If the software is an end product, the project document shall also include user and maintenance documentation. The latter two shall ordinarily be separate from the project description, though they may be presented as appendices. The work submitted for the master’s project, including both the code and the document, is required to be the individual work of the student. The student is allowed and encouraged to solicit review and comment, including editorial suggestions, especially from the major professor and supervisory committee members. However, the student and advisor should keep in mind that by awarding a master’s degree in computer science the department is certifying that the student has mastered technical English writing to a level that is acceptable for a professional. If the master’s project software is part of a larger software development or research project, it may make use of other software components that were not written by the student, but such other components shall be clearly identified and separated from the contributions of the student. Further, if the master’s project is part of a larger project, the organization of the larger project must allow the master’s student a high degree of autonomy and individual responsibility for a well defined and clearly partitioned segment of the project, from the inception to completion of the segment. The application of the above criteria to the project is up to the individual student’s supervisory committee. The committee shall be formed by the start of the project, and registered with the Director of Graduate Studies. All committee members shall be given an early opportunity to review the scope and technical approach of the project, before work has progressed too far to make whatever modifications may be needed to obtain their approval. The project defense is primarily a test of the student’s oral communication skills. When scheduling the defense, the student shall allow at least ten days to two weeks for review of the final paper by the committee after it has been approved by the major professor. It is the responsibility of the student to schedule the defense and reserve the room and the PC cart through the Graduate Coordinator. Once the project has been defended and all modifications suggested by the major professor and committee have been made, an electronic version must be submitted to the webmaster. Appropriate copyright notices and authorizations should be given to allow the department to distribute the document. The first page of the report should have the student author’s name, the title, and the names of the major professor and committee members.",

          "context": "PhD Degree Information | PhD Degree Information The number of hours for the graduate degree as described in this web page will be effective in Summer 2018. Graduate Student Handbook – Doctoral Degree The Doctor of Philosophy is regarded as a research degree and is awarded on the basis of accomplishment in a recognized specialty in computer science. Such accomplishment should include scholarly mastery of the field, significant contributions to new knowledge in the field, and written and oral communication skills appropriate for the field. The requirements for the Ph.D. include the following: passing CIS 8962, the qualifying examination (portfolio defense), and CIS 8964, preliminary examination (area exam); satisfaction of the course requirements; successfully defending a dissertation prospectus, and successfully defending a dissertation. All candidates for doctoral degrees in the department are required to participate in teaching activities at some time during their graduate careers unless waived by the department chair. Additionally, each doctoral student must complete at least one oral research presentation which is critiqued by at least one faculty member. This can be at the departmental research conference or any discipline-related conference. Each PhD has a Publication Requirement and as such that student is required to be the primary (e.g., first) author for at least one accepted or published regular paper (six or more pages) in a conference or journal that is ranked B or higher by the Computing Research and Education Association (CORE) [ http://www.core.edu.au ]. Course Requirements The doctoral student must complete the undergraduate pre-requisites before graduating. The doctoral student should have completed four core courses (18 hours), with at least one course in each of the three areas Software, Systems, and Theory (the PhD core course requirement ). These core courses are defined in the FSU Master’s degree requirements . Equivalent courses taken at other institutions must be approved by the Portfolio Evaluation Committee (PEC). Students entering the program after earning a Master’s degree in Computer Science or related area must take at least four additional courses (12 hours) beyond those taken for the MS degree, at the 5000 or 6000 level, as advised by the student’s major professor and supervisory committee. These courses must be taken at FSU and a maximum of 2 courses (6 hours) may come from outside of the department. Core courses can also be used to meet this “4 additional course” requirement, provided they are taken at FSU and were not completed as part of an MS program. Supervised Teaching, Supervised Research, DIS and courses with prefix CGS do not count towards this requirement. Students entering the program after earning a bachelor’s degree in computer science or related area, must take at least nine courses (27 hours) at the 5000 or 6000 level, as advised by the student’s major professor and supervisory committee. Four of these courses (12 hours) must meet the PhD core course requirement. The remaining five courses (15 hours) must be taken at FSU and cannot be part of an MS degree program outside of the FSU Computer Science Department. A maximum of two courses (6 hours) may come from outside of the Computer Science Department. Supervised teaching, supervised research, DIS, and courses with prefix CGS do not count towards this requirement. If a PhD student takes CIS5920 Colloquium three times and gets an S each time, then this may substitute for one 3 hour course. The student’s PhD committee can require the student to take more than the aforementioned number of courses. The student must receive a grade of “B-” or better on all graduate courses taken to satisfy the minimum course requirements of the degree. Once these minimum requirements are met, however, it is permissible to take any subsequent courses on an “S/U” basis. Once a student has completed twenty-seven (27) semester hours of graduate work or has been awarded the Master’s degree, the student must be enrolled on The Florida State University Tallahassee campus for a minimum of twenty-four (24) graduate semester hours credit within a continuous 12-month period to meet the university residency requirement. The doctoral student must also complete at least twenty-four (24) hours of CIS 6980r Dissertation. A student may enroll in CIS 6980r only after being admitted to candidacy. Once admitted to candidacy, Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two Dissertation hours each semester until completion (of degree) and must graduate with the doctoral degree within five years of being admitted to doctoral candidacy. Major Professor and Supervisory Committee As early as is feasible in the student’s program, the student should identify an area for dissertation research and secure an informal agreement with a faculty member to serve as the student’s major professor. This agreement should include an understanding of the area and timeline of the dissertation research. This agreement is then made formal by the Department Chair appointing that faculty member to serve in this capacity. In a similar manner, the student must secure agreements with, and the Chair must approve, the remaining members of the student’s Supervisory Committee: one (1) additional faculty members in the Department; one (1) Representative-at-large who is a member of the graduate faculty in another department. Graduate Studies requires the representative-at-large to ensure “that University policies are followed, and that decisions made by the supervisory committee reflect the collective judgment of the committee. Therefore, the graduate faculty representative must be someone who is free of conflicts of interest with other members of the committee.” If there are any questions as to the appropriateness of a particular faculty member to serve in this role, the Dean of Graduate Studies should be contacted. In addition, the Chair will appoint a member to serve as a Department Representative. All members must hold doctoral directive status. The supervisory committee is responsible for approving an individual program of study, including any additional course requirements, and verifying that the student satisfies the following departmental requirements. The area examination, prospectus, and dissertation defenses must be unanimously approved by the major professor and supervisory committee. Student Portfolio Defense (CIS 8962, Qualifying Exam) All students admitted to the program, but not yet admitted to candidacy, are required to compile and keep current a portfolio containing information relevant to the student’s progress in the program. Required contents of the portfolio, submission dates, and guidelines for preparing the portfolio are published by the Department of Computer Science at PhD Portfolio. When all components of the portfolio are complete, the student should register for the portfolio defense (CIS 8962). The portfolio of any student not yet in candidacy is reviewed annually by the departmental Portfolio Evaluation Committee (PEC). This committee consists of a core that is appointed by the Department Chair and normally meets in the spring. Feedback to the student on the contents of the portfolio and on progress towards admission to candidacy is provided after each review. The final review occurs in conjunction with the defense of the portfolio. Thus, when a student and his or her major professor agree the portfolio is complete, the student should register for the Doctoral Qualifying Exam, CIS 8962 (0) for the next semester. Students will be required to pass an oral examination over the material in four core courses, with at least one course in each of the three areas Software, Systems, and Theory (the PhD core course requirement). If a student has taken a core course at FSU and has received a grade of an A-, then the student is exempt from having to take an oral examination in that course. If the student is not successful on the first sitting of the Qualifying Exam, a grade of “I” will be assigned. If the second sitting of the exam is also unsuccessful, a grade of “F” is assigned. A student can take the Qualifying Exam at most twice. A student either passes or fails; there is no conditional pass. If the student is successful, he or she should register for CIS 6900 DIS hours to maintain enrollment status until the completion of the Area Examination (CIS 8964, Preliminary Exam). Prior to this benchmark, PhD’s should use CIS 5900 DIS hours to reflect research efforts as they complete the coursework and ready themselves for the Qualifying Exam (CIS 8962). Area Examination (CIS 8964, Preliminary Exam) The area examination (CIS 8964) covers the student’s intended area of research. It has both written and oral parts. Both parts of the examination are conducted by the student’s supervisory committee, which may delegate the responsibility to a larger area committee. It is strongly recommended that the student write an area survey paper as part of this exam. The oral part is open to all department faculty having doctoral status who elect to participate. The oral part of the examination is held in an open forum which other students are invited to attend and is followed by a closed session if the committee so desires. Students who do not pass the area exam may be advised to retake it at a later time. A student who changes to a new research area after having previously passed this exam will be required to stand for a further exam over the new area. A student can fail the area exam at most once. A PhD CS student can be exempt from writing the document for the area exam if the student was the primary author on an accepted or published paper in the general intended research area and the student’s PhD committee deems the paper and the publication venue to be acceptable.  However, an oral examination for the area exam is still required.  The student’s PhD committee may allow the student to present the accepted or published paper in place of the normal presentation of the research area, but the PhD committee can still ask the student questions about the intended area of research. Normal expectations are that the portfolio defense occurs prior to taking the area exam, or at least in the same semester as the area exam. Within two semesters (including summer) of passing the QE, a doctoral student should have taken the area exam. Admission to Candidacy In order to be advanced to candidacy for the doctoral degree, the student must: pass CIS 8962, the qualifying examination, which consists of passing the defense of the portfolio, and pass CIS 8964, the preliminary exam, which consists of passing the area examination. Suggested Timeline by the end of the first academic year, a doctoral student who entered the program with an MS degree, should have completed the QE and established a doctoral committee for a doctoral student who entered the program without an MS degree, the student should have completed the QE and formed a doctoral committee by the end of the second academic year within two semesters (including summer) of passing the QE, a doctoral student should have taken the PE (area exam). Prospectus The student must formally propose the research for the dissertation to his or her Supervisory Committee in the form of a prospectus. The prospectus should consist of much of the background work for the dissertation, including: thorough literature review; the theory, preliminary computational results, and/or bases for the feasibility of the research; a proposal for the research to be completed for the dissertation. In addition, as an appendix to the prospectus, publication plans should be presented. The research proposed should make clear any substantial advances in the state of knowledge in computer science, and the publication plans should be designed to affirm the quality and nature of the research. The publication should be in nationally recognized conferences and journals in the field. The prospectus must be successfully defended before the student’s supervisory committee in an open meeting. Dissertation After completing the research proposed in the prospectus, the student must write a dissertation. The dissertation represents the fulfillment of the proposals made in the prospectus. The dissertation document must comply with all current University standards for style. The dissertation must be successfully defended before the student’s committee in an open meeting. The dissertation must be successfully defended within five (5) years of passing the preliminary exam. An electronic version of the dissertation must be submitted to the university as well as the CS webmaster, and CS graduate coordinator. Scholarly Engagement Requirement Each CS doctoral student must be scholarly engaged during their academic studies. A PhD CS student meets the scholarly engagement requirement by giving at least one presentation at an FSU CS graduate student seminar, an FSU CS Department seminar, or at an international conference. It is also recommended that each PhD CS student attends as many department and graduate student colloquia as possible. Publication Requirement Each PhD student is required to be the primary (e.g., first) author for at least one accepted or published regular paper (six or more pages) in a conference or journal that is ranked B or higher by the Computing Research and Education Association (CORE) [ http://www.core.edu.au ]; see the here on how to request an exception. Examination in Defense of Dissertation The defense of the dissertation will be oral. Responsibility for suggesting the time, designating the place, and presiding at the examination rests with the major professor. It is recommended that students defend no later than the eighth week of classes in the semester of intent to graduate. Students must defend by no later than the Format Approval Deadline in the semester of intent to graduate. Consult the Graduate School Canvas site GradSpace for more information. Academic courtesy requires that the dissertation be submitted to each member of the supervisory committee at least four weeks before the date of the oral examination. The supervisory committee, the chair of the major department, and such other members of the faculty as may be appointed by the academic dean will conduct the examination. All members of the graduate faculty are invited to attend. At least two weeks prior to the date of the examination, the student or major professor will present an announcement of the dissertation title and the date and place of the examination to the Graduate School. Consult the Registration Guide for the deadline dates All committee members and the student must attend the entire defense in real-time, either by being physically present or participating via distance technology. If exceptional emergency circumstances, e.g. medical or other emergency situations, prevent the participation of a committee member then it may be necessary to arrange for an additional appropriately qualified colleague to attend the defense. A minimum of four members with Graduate Faculty Status must participate. The oral examining committee will certify in writing to the academic dean of the major department the results of the examination: passed, failed, or to be re-examined. The report of results following a re-examination must indicate the student either passed or failed. To receive a passing grade, the written dissertation must be in final form or require only minor revisions at the time of the defense. A grade of PASS for the defense of treatise or dissertation requires at least a majority approval of the committee. If the student passes, each member must sign the Manuscript Signature Form to substantiate the results of the defense. It is the responsibility of the major professor to submit this completed form either directly to the Clearance Advisor or to the appropriate college or departmental office for subsequent delivery to the Clearance Advisor in The Graduate School. A written critique of the conduct of the examination in defense of the dissertation should be submitted by the university representative from the graduate faculty to the appropriate academic dean and the Dean of the Graduate School within one week after the date of defense. The degree cannot be awarded until both forms have been received by the Graduate School and the final version of the manuscript has been submitted to and approved by the Clearance Advisor.",

          "context": "Portfolio | Portfolio PhD Student Portfolio Guidelines The portfolio is the principal artifact used by the department to monitor progress of doctoral students and to determine if a student is ready to take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam, which is a required component of admission to candidacy. This document is intended as a guide to the portfolio component of these requirements. Adhering to these guidelines is a requirement for continuing in the doctoral program. Portfolio Requirement Every Computer Science doctoral student is required to assemble and submit a portfolio for review no later than the date specified under Portfolio Calendar below. Portfolios are reviewed on a regular basis (generally once a year, during the Spring term) by the Portfolio Evaluation Committee (PEC), a faculty committee appointed by the department chair. Feedback to the student on portfolio contents and on progress towards admission to candidacy is provided as a result of these reviews. New portfolios should be submitted to the student’s academic advisor for preliminary review. The advisor may suggest that the student make modifications. Students should print the cover page form and include the form with the Portfolio for submission to the academic advisor for review. When the advisor is satisfied, the advisor will sign the cover page form and transmit the portfolio on to the PEC. Admission to candidacy for the PhD degree consists of two milestones: CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam CIS 8964 Doctoral Preliminary Exam (Area Exam) A grade of “P” must be earned in both of these. Normally the Doctoral Qualifying Exam would precede, or at least occur in the same semester as, the Area Exam. See below under Portfolio Review and Qualifying Exam for the procedure to follow. Portfolio Calendar During the first semester in the program , the student should assemble a portfolio and submit it to the department office through the student’s academic advisor. This initial portfolio should be submitted as soon as possible, but in no case later than the end of the first semester. (It is understood that the portfolio will not be complete at this point.) Every Fall and Spring semester prior to the student’s admission to candidacy, the student is required to maintain the currency of the portfolio by updating it, asking his or her advisor to review it, and obtaining the advisor’s signature on the portfolio cover page form , by the end of the second week of the semester. At least once a year , typically in the Spring, the portfolio will be reviewed by the Portfolio Evaluation Committee. The result of the review will be advisory in nature. When the student wishes to take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam : For the term in which the student wishes to take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam, the student should enroll in the course CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam . In order for the student to register for the Qualifying Exam the student’s and the student’s major professor must sign a portfolio cover page form indicating that the professor has reviewed the portfolio and considers it complete . The CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam will be scheduled during that semester. Full time students entering with a Masters in Computer Science should normally expect to take the Qualifying Exam near the end of their first year. Full time students entering directly from a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science should normally expect to take the Qualifying Exam near the end of their second year. For all students, the CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam should normally occur soon after the core course requirements have been met. After admission to candidacy , the portfolio should not be modified. It will be archived by the department staff. Copies of the progress reports prepared by the student’s major professor should be placed in the student’s regular departmental advisement file. Portfolio Content & Organization Every student in the FSU Computer Science doctoral program is required to prepare a three-ring binder containing as much as possible of the information described below. For each major section, please begin the corresponding section in your binder with a tabbed separator labeled so as to identify the section heading. All sections are required to be included. Summary Data Complete the following table on personal information: Personal Information Your Name: Your FSUSN: Date entered program (semester/year): Full or part time student? Principal source of support: Give the names of your dissertation advisor and other committee members. If the committee has not yet been formed, please indicate this with ‘TBD’. Note that advance into candidacy can only be approved when a committee has been appointed. Doctoral Committee Major Professor / Advisor Committee Member Committee Member Committee Member External Committee Member Complete the following table on core courses (see the Graduate Bulletin for information on the core course requirements). You must complete four (4) core courses in total: at least one course from each of the three core areas. List these four core courses in the table below. Note that only those core courses you completed with a grade of B or higher will count towards the complete set of four, so only list the core courses with a grade of B or higher: Core Graduate Courses and Grades Core Area Core Course Semester Taken or Planned Name of Instructor Grade Received Software Systems Theory Any If you are requesting that courses taken at other institutions be counted toward the core, please provide supporting documentation showing the equivalence. In addition, our department’s Director of Graduate Studies or another qualified graduate faculty member has to make an examination and determine that the course is equivalent. Obtain a letter or memo signed by this person and put a copy in the portfolio. In any case, include in your portfolio a copy of the course syllabus, including at least the information about the prerequisites, topics, and textbook or other references used, and copies of whatever graded work (examinations, projects, etc.) you have retained from the course. In general, to be equivalent, a course must be a graduate course, with similar prerequisites, a similar list of topics, and similar performance expectations. For example, a course in operating systems will not be considered equivalent to COP 5611 unless it is a “second semester” course, i.e. one for which there is another operating systems course like COP 4610 as prerequisite. For the theory area, the course grade must be based on the ability to do mathematical proofs. For the software area, the course must involve substantial hands-on software development, with a mature level of documentation and testing. Complete the following table on elective courses, including all the graduate courses you have taken (including thesis and DIS courses) that are not in the list of core courses above. Elective Courses and Grades Elective Course Semester Taken or Planned Name of Instructor Grade Received GPA for elective courses: Complete the following table for all area exams you have taken or plan to take. The last row should be the exam you have taken or plan to take for your current degree. Area Exams Exam Coverage Area Date of Exam (semester/year) Result of Exam State whether you have chosen a doctoral research topic and, if known, give a brief description of the proposed research. (one or two sentences) Curriculum Vitae The CV should contain the following information: Academic degrees: List all degrees you have earned to date, including for each degree the date it was conferred, the subject area, and the institution’s name and general location. Professional employment: List any teaching or research assistantships, any fellowships, and any nonacademic jobs providing training or experience in Computer Science or closely related areas. For teaching and research assistantships, indicate level of effort, e.g., whether these were 1/2 time, 1/4 time, etc. appointments. Honors and Awards: List any special academic honors, awards, or honor society memberships. Publications: List all published writings for which you are the author or a co-author. Service: Indicate anything you have done which either directly or indirectly benefited the department, university, or the Computer Science profession–e.g., officer of the student ACM chapter, reviewer for professional conference or journal, assistance at any professional conference, help at science fairs, service in local public schools, etc. Research Publications and Writing Begin this required section by repeating the publication list cited in your CV. Place a reprint or photocopy of one research publication or technical writing of which you were the primary author or writer , provided that: If the publication has three authors or fewer in total, then state the role you played in this publication, i.e., what was your role in the research and in the writing of the paper? If your writing was edited by a co-author (such as your advisor), then you should clearly indicate this. If all of your publications have four authors or more in total, or if you were not the person primarily responsible for writing the paper, or if you have no publications, then you must contribute a work of a research or technical nature which you personally created. This could be your Masters Thesis, or if you have not written a thesis, then some other research-oriented or technical writing, such as a term paper, or the area survey paper, or a technical report for which you were the primary author. Software Engineering A person holding the PhD in Computer Science is expected to have the ability to contribute substantially to significant software artifacts. As such, one such artifact is a required component of the doctoral portfolio. Include a copy of ONE such artifact, including design, engineering, and certification reports, software documentation , and actual code.A listing of unidentified uncommented code is not sufficient. The portfolio must include enough external documentation and internal comments for the reviewers to read and evaluate the scope and quality of the software. Some indication must be included of how the quality of the software was tested. If the software is something submitted for grade in a course, you should include the instructor’s statement of the assignment as external documentation, but that is not sufficient; the code must at least include internal comments. Similarly, for a course assignment you may provide the grade you received, and any comments the instructor made, as part of the “certification report”, but you also should explain how you tested it.For large projects, only indicative samples of the actual code need be included, but the full code should be available either on-line or as a separate document. If lengthy, these items may be submitted in a separate binder. If you include a CD containing materials, please include printed copy of at least some overview material, with pointers to the CD for the rest.If any of the software or documentation components are the work of more than one author, you must indicate what parts of these components you contributed to and estimate the percent of your personal contribution to each part. Moreover, it is best that you also include some examples of your individual work. Dissertation Research Write a 1-2 page abstract describing your intended area of dissertation research. Include indications of progress you have made. Support List all employment you have had while a graduate student in the department along with the begin/end dates of that employment. Include TA/RA positions, other work within FSU, as well as outside employment. We are interested in some detail, for example, if you are research assistant, describe the position, work requirements (in terms of both effort and outcome), and who the employer/supervisor is. This information is relevant both for the extent to which your activities support your educational objectives and the extent to which they may occupy your time in activities not related to your degree program. For each RA and TA position you have held at FSU, include here photocopies of your semesterly evaluation of performance in those positions. List all fellowship support you have while a student in our program. List the granting agency, the academic and ancillary requirements, and the amount of funding for each fellowship. Lectures All candidates for doctoral degrees in the department are required to participate in teaching activities at some time during their graduate careers, which will allow them to make an informed decision regarding whether or not they may wish to pursue a career in academia. Therefore, every candidate is required to either teach a course or serve as a recitation instructor for a course before they graduate. This experience can be part of their TA duties or can be obtained at another university prior to coming to FSU. In this section include supportive material that demonstrates lecture preparation and presentation material. Alternatively, include recitation presentation material in case you were assigned recitation responsibilities. This requirement can be waived by the Department chair in special circumstances only. When waived by the Chair, please include a copy of the memo. Documentation Supportive documentation should include: Previous Portfolio Reviews (when applicable)As discussed above, doctoral student portfolios will be reviewed regularly by the Portfolio Review Committee, and each student will be sent a letter indicating the committee’s evaluation of the student’s progress toward the degree. Photocopies of all such letters to date are to appear in this section of the portfolio. Transcripts To the extent these are available, include copies of your transcripts from prior institutions, i.e., universities or colleges you attended prior to your beginning as a graduate student in Computer Science at FSU. If you submitted transcripts with your application to our graduate program, the departmental staff can make photocopies of these for you from your application file, if you so request. GRE and TOEFL Score Reports (when available)In this section, place photocopies of the official reporting forms of your GRE and TOEFL scores reported in section 1 above. When you opt to omit it, the department will retrieve this information electronically. Area Exam Reports In this section place photocopies of the result reports from all area exams you have taken. Portfolio Review and Qualifying Exam The PhD Portfolio is intended to provide the department with a complete view of the student’s accomplishments and abilities that relate to likelihood of success as a PhD professional. The portfolio is reviewed regularly by the Portfolio Evaluation Committee to determine whether the student is making suitable progress towards the degree, and must be completed with a list of the satisfactory grades (B or higher) for the four core graduate courses when the student takes the Doctoral Qualifying Exam. Based on the completion of the portfolio, a student can enroll in CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam. A passing grade “P” for the CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam is one of the two required components of admission to candidacy. The student should be enrolled in CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam when he or she has completed the four core graduate courses, completed the portfolio, and both the student and major professor agree that the student is ready to take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam. ( Doctoral Qualifying Exams may be scheduled for Fall or Spring semester, but not Summer semester.) The Portfolio Evaluation Committee will schedule and conduct the Doctoral Qualifying Exam during the semester. The exam will be oral and will cover the four core graduate courses taken by the student. The student will be tested on the four core graduate course topics. The student is strongly advised to study the core course topics well in advance in preparation for the Doctoral Qualifying Exam. A student cannot take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam if he or she has not completed the four core graduate courses. However, there is one exception to this rule. A student who has received satisfactory grades with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher for all but one of the core courses can take the Qualifying Exam in the Spring term in which the last core course is being taken, assuming that the Qualifying Exams take place after spring break. In that case, the student is expected to be able to answer questions about all of the four core courses, including the core course currently being taken. If the student passes the oral, the exam is not recorded as passed until after the end of the term, and the chair of the Portfolio Evaluation Committee has verified that the remaining core course has been passed with an acceptable grade. In evaluating the portfolio for the Doctoral Qualifying Exam, no single aspect of the portfolio is taken as a determining factor, but rather an attempt is made to consider all strengths and weaknesses and to determine whether, overall, the student may reasonably be expected to succeed and become a credit to the department. Components of such success generally are as follows: General competency in Computer Science.In order to demonstrate adequate mastery of the breadth of Computer Science, we ordinarily expect a successful candidate to maintain a GPA of at least 3.5 in the core courses required for the degree . A GPA below 3.5 for the core courses is sufficient cause to deny permission to take the Qualifying Exam, unless convincing justifications are presented to the committee for consideration. Candidates may refer to the grading scale for PhD students in graduate courses that has been adopted by the department. The Portfolio Evaluation Committee may make exceptions to this GPA rule if it finds compelling evidence of exceptional strength in research. For example, a slightly lower GPA might be offset by published papers in reputable journals or conference proceedings. Note that the four core courses you took must be completed with a B or higher grade. If a student receives an A in a CS graduate core course at FSU, then the student is exempt from taking the exam. If you completed a core course with an unsatisfactory grade of B- or lower, do not list this course as a core course but list the course as an elective. Then sign up for another core course in that same core area to ensure you have taken four core courses, with at least one course from each core area.The Doctoral Qualifying Exam tests the general knowledge of the candidate in areas covered by the four core graduate courses. Research Aptitude.Research is a critical component of the PhD degree process and is a fundamental part of most professional positions that require a PhD as credentials. The department would like to admit to candidacy individuals who have demonstrated the ability, or aptitude, for research in the field. Software Skills.The creation of computer software is a fundamental part of computer science, and the department generally expects that its graduates possess the skills and training necessary to contribute to such endeavors. Communication Skills.The department wishes to see that the student has a capacity to express his or her thoughts in publication-quality English. Thus there is a requirement that the Portfolio contain some writing sample that demonstrates written communication skills, and the Doctoral Qualifying Exam serves to evaluate spoken communication skills. The writing requirement may be met by a professional publication, masters thesis, a masters degree project report, or any other writing that the student may have produced as part of his or her course work. Note that an ability to present one’s ideas in written English is considered as separate from an ability to conduct research, and that both abilities are deemed necessary.The department also wishes to see that the student is capable of responding extemporaneously to oral questions, as a researcher is required to do when presenting a paper at a conference and a professor is required to do when teaching. The Doctoral Qualifying Exam is a test of these oral communication skills. The student will be expected to be able to understand the questions presented by the examiners, and to answer them on the spot. PhD Grading Scale The Florida State University Department of Computer Science has adopted a grade interpretation scale for PhD students and any other students who take graduate courses in the department and may wish at some future time to enter the PhD program. Effective Fall 2002, grades in graduate courses taught by Computer Science Department faculty will use this grade interpretation scale. The scale is given by the following table. Course Grade CS Department Interpretation A Performance met or exceeded expectations for PhD students A- Performance met expectations for PhD students B+ Performance was marginally below expectations for PhD students B Performance was significantly below expectations for PhD students B- Performance was unsatisfactory for PhD students C+ or below Performance was unsatisfactory for graduate work Frequently Asked Questions Q: Can I substitute another course for one of the four required core courses? How about doing it just for the Portfolio Review, if I promise to take the course later?A: No. The Qualifying Exam is the point at which the Department checks for completion of the required core courses and the quality of work in those courses. Until you take the course we have no way to tell how well you will have done in the course.Of course, with adequate justification, departments at FSU are permitted to approve course substitutions in degree requirements. The PEC will only consider a substitution if the Portfolio contains a copy of a letter approving a course substitution for the degree requirements, signed by Director of Graduate Studies and the Department Chair. Q: I received a B- for a core course. Should I take another core course and have that one count towards to four core courses?A: Yes, you can choose another core course as long as you take at least three core courses to cover all three core areas as part of the total of four core courses you want to count towards the Qualifying Exam. Q: What kind of oral questions can I expect at the Qualifying Exam?A: That will be up to the individual members of the PEC. You should expect questions on the four areas: (a) general competency in CS; (b) research aptitude; (c) software skills; (d) communication skills. If the portfolio itself is strong, all or most of the questions are likely to be on (a). In area (a) the intent of the questions will be to gauge your understanding and retention of material normally covered in the four core courses and their undergraduate prerequisites. For example, if you have taken Automata and Formal Languages as part of your core requirement, you should not be take by surprise if you are asked to explain what is a finite state machine, what is the difference between a deterministic and a non deterministic finite state machine, what it means for a gramar to be ambiguous, how that compares to a language being inherently ambiguous, etc. .Be sure to have your major professor, and possibly others, help you prepare for such questions. Minimal preparation would include reviewing your notes from the core courses, and then answering some oral questions from each of the areas they cover.A big part of preparing for the exam is learning to be comfortable listening to questions, making sure you understand (by asking for clarification if necessary), and then expressing yourself clearly. You will have an easel and pen to write on. Plan to use it appropriately, to help with your answer. A “mock” oral examination is a good way to practice.Students who have not taken the core courses recently, or who have transferred credit for a core course from another institution, should expect to be asked more questions on the core courses, to verify that the knowledge has not become stale, and that the material learned is similar in scope and depth to what is covered in the corresponding course here at FSU. Similarly, if you took the course at FSU but your grade was not A or A-, you may expect more questions on that course. In area (b) you might expect questions concerning your research experience, your contributions to any research papers in your portfolio, your research plans, and the membership of your supervisory committee. In area (c) you might expect questions on what software you wrote, and the examples of software you included in your portfolio. In area (d) you might expect questions on the technical writing samples you included in your portfolio, but mainly the committee will be judging your communication skills by the manner in which you answer the questions about (a). That is: Can you understand the question? Can you ask appropriate questions for clarification? Can you give a clear answer? How well you do these things in the exam will be viewed as indication of your ability to function in a classroom, and as a speaker at a research conference. These are just examples, not intended to limit the options of individual committee members. Along with the questions, if the questions do not take up all of the available time, you can expect some encouraging words about the strong points of your portfolio, and some constructive advice as to how to proceed. Q: Can I take the Qualifying Exam during the summer term?A: No, or at least you should not count on it. Very few of the faculty are available during the summer as they tend to leave town to attend conference meetings. If there happen to be enough members of the PEC in town, an exam may be held in exceptional cases. Q: Can I do my Area Examination before my Qualifying Exam?A: Not officially. The course number for the Area Examination is listed as the Ph.D. Preliminary Examination, and the FSU Graduate Bulletin says that a student is admitted to Ph.D. candidacy by passing the Preliminary Examination. Our department’s faculty has set up the admission to candidacy as a two-step process. The necessary first step is the Qualifying Exam. In a few cases, for scheduling reasons, a student may go through the Area Examination process, but a passing grade for the Area Examination cannot be turned in until the student has completed the Qualifying Exam. If the are done the same term, this can work out. Students and advisors should take care about this. If, by some oversight, a passing grade for the Area Examination were to be turned in before the student passes the Qualifying Exam, the Department would need to revoke the passing grade on the Area Examination until the Qualifying Exam is passed. Q: What if I took courses at another institution, that I want to count toward my core requirement?A: First, you should have obtained some clearance for transfer credit when you were admitted, and you should put a copy of a letter or memo to this effect in your portfolio. Second, you should include in your portfolio the name of the textbook you used in the course, a copy of the course syllabus, and examples of graded exams and projects form the course. This will enable the PEC to gauge whether the course seems equivalent, and to know what sort of questions to ask during your oral examination on that area. Q: When will I know whether I passed?A: The PEC will probably wait to tell anyone until all of the students taking the Qualifying Exam that term have completed the exam. Q: Can I talk with other students about the exam, after I take it?A: You are asked not to discuss questions you were asked on the oral exam with anyone, until you are told the result of the exam. This allows us to be fairer to all students. For example, suppose you have trouble on a question. It may be that all students have trouble with that question, and the committee decides to disregard it. However, if you tell another student who is due to take the exam later, and the other student then looks up the answer and so answers better than you did, the committee may conclude that the question was not hard, and that you have no excuse for answering poorly. Q: Do I need to form my entire Ph.D. supervisory committee before I take the Qualifying Exam?A: This is not a requirement, but if you do not yet have your supervisory committee formed you need to do it right away, because you need the full supervisory committee before you can move on to the next step, which is the Area Examination. Q: Do I need to choose my research area before I take the Qualifying Exam?A: This is not a requirement, but if you do not yet have your area chosen you need to do it right away, since you can’t prepare for the CIS 8964 Preliminary Exam until you have chosen an area.",

          "context": "Policy on Tutors | Policy on Tutors This department discourages the use of tutors. Students who have problems in a course should first contact their instructor. A student who needs a modest amount of individual help should get it from the instructor and teaching assistants for the course. While we cannot prevent a student from hiring a tutor, we will not endorse or recommend anyone as a tutor, nor will we act as intermediary for students attempting to locate a tutor. This policy is based on the following considerations: We want to hear if students are having trouble in a course. If a student has the prerequisites for a course and is putting in the expected level of effort, and if the course is being taught well enough, there should be no need for a tutor. When students hire tutors instead of going to the instructor or department administration to solve their problems it can make it appear to the instructor and the department that everything is going well when in fact it is not. For example: if there is a need to spend more time teaching a particular topic, the instructor needs to find out; if the student is missing necessary background, it may be best for the student to switch to another course; if the instructor is not doing the job well, the department chair should hear about it. In short, if there is a serious problem we want to be informed of it and to solve it. This is the main reason for the policy. We cannot guarantee the competence of a tutor. An incompetent or misinformed tutor could do a student academic harm. Student problems are often very specific to material that is covered in class, or that is related to a programming assignment. Since tutors do not attend the class meetings, they will not be well informed. If a student hires a tutor and the tutor teaches the student something different from what the instructor is teaching, the student will suffer. We have seen cases of tutors helping students do programming assignments. This is a big temptation for the student and the tutor, since it is much quicker and easier to show a person how to solve a specific homework problem or programming assignment than it is to help the student learn the skills needed to solve the problem on his/her own. When this happens it is bad in two ways: It is a violation of the FSU Academic Honor Code . The student’s final grade suffers. Since the learning objectives of the assignment are not accomplished, the student will not have the knowledge and skills to pass the examinations. This can result in a student having even an “A” average on homework and failing the course. (It is common for courses to have a policy that examination grades must be at least passing in order for a student to pass a course, no matter how high the grades on unsupervised work.) Using a tutor in a college course is unfair to other students, in the sense that it gives students with extra money an advantage over students who might work as hard or harder but who have less money to spend. Note: The policy of discouraging the use of tutors does not apply to accommodations for disabilities that are approved by the Student Disability Resource Center . If such a student wants to find a tutor, there are usually some upper level undergraduate students and graduate students who are willing to serve as tutors. Notices soliciting and offering tutoring services show up on bulletin boards in the Love Building from time to time.",

Description of Major Criminology and Criminal Justice and Computer Science have collaborated to offer this new interdisciplinary degree in Cyber Criminology. Information-related crime, cyber-forensics, and computer/network security are significant issues that affect all levels of business, government, and academia. Cyber criminology includes both how to use computers to facilitate the study of crime and the study of how crimes are accomplished through the use of computers. Students will be prepared to do graduate work and research in this area, or to be effective employees of government, law enforcement, and industry, thereby filling the pressing need for information technology specialists who can address these issues. Prerequisite Coursework The following may also be used to meet Liberal Studies and/or major requirements COP XXXX (3) Computer Programming MAC X105 (3) College Algebra MAC X140 (3) Precalculus Note: State-wide common prerequisites are always under review.

All students in the CS department should meet with their Computer Science Undergraduate Academic Advisor prior to registration to discuss their options for the upcoming semester(s). There are four different degree programs within the Computer Science Department at FSU: the B.S. in Computer Science, the B.A. in Computer Science, the B.S. in Cyber Criminology, and the B.S. in Computational Biology. Please review the Undergraduate Program webpage for detailed information on each of these majors. Computer Science Academic Maps An Academic Map is available to assist students in creating schedules for any major at FSU. This plan is based upon the current course requirements and is subject to change. You may use this four-year plan as a general guide, but always check with your Computer Science Academic Advisor at least two weeks prior to your registration date to verify that you are taking the best classes for you. Liberal Studies & Other General Degree Requirements Complete information on Liberal Studies, Oral Competency, Computer Competency, and the “X” and “Y” Multicultural Requirements can be found through the Division of Undergraduate Studies and the latest version of It’s All Academic . In general, given the number of prerequisites CS majors must complete, we advise students to find liberal studies courses that satisfy multiple requirements at the same time. For example, a given humanities course might be literature-based (*), Gordon Rule (w), and Cross Cultural (x). The following includes some notes about how CS students typically complete Liberal Studies and other general requirements: Math : This is satisfied through the math courses any CS student will take for their degree. Natural Science : BS in CS and Computational Biology students have specific Natural Science courses they must take for their respective degree programs. Other degree programs have more flexibility. English Composition : Students must complete the freshman composition sequence within their first year at the University. This is a mapping requirement. History : Possible source of “x” or “y” courses. Likely source of “w” Gordon Rule writing courses. Social Science : Possible source of “x” or “y” courses, as well as a few “w” Gordon Rule writing courses. Humanities/Fine Arts : Possible source of “x” or “y” courses. Likely source of “w” Gordon Rule writing courses. Oral Communication Competency Requirement : CIS 4250 Ethics and Computer Science meets the Oral Competency requirement of the University. This is a required course for BS in CS majors. x (Cross Cultural) and y (Western Diversity) multicultural courses. Select at least one “x” course and one “y” course when selecting your History/Social Science and Humanities/Fine Arts courses. You can find out which courses are “x” and “y” in It’s All Academic . Gordon Rule (Writing) Courses: Gordon Rule classes are designated by a “w” in It’s All Academic . College of Arts and Science Requirements The Computer Science Department is part of the College of Arts and Sciences. In addition to University requirements, students with major codes within Arts and Sciences must meet College of Arts and Sciences requirements . What Math Do I Take Next? Select your HIGHEST math course “passed/accepted” after the current semester, whether taken at FSU or accepted by dual enrollment, AP scores, or SAT/ACT scores. This is your next math course:",

          "context": "WHY MAJOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE | WHY MAJOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE There are several very good reasons to major in computer science. First, our majors rarely have any trouble finding jobs (click for details) . Computer programming and related skills are more in demand every year and the demand for skilled computer scientists far exceeds the supply as shown in the graph below. These skills are also becoming essential in a wide variety of other disciplines, including almost every area of science and engineering. Computer science related jobs in the United States are still increasing, despite offshoring of some positions. A high percentage of our undergraduate students have part time jobs due to the high demand for their skills even before they graduate. Second, our graduates are well paid. Please peruse the information shown below on this page. While the starting salaries for computer scientists can vary over the years, it has consistently been one of the best paying majors for the last several decades. The graph at the bottom of the page shows that the salaries for new graduates in Computer Science has continued to rise and is the best paying profession for the most popular college majors. Last and most importantly, computer science is fun. Programming is similar to solving a puzzle. Once you get the knack of doing it, the process becomes fun. However, computer science is far more than just programming. Keep reading if you wish to know more about our program and peruse our web pages for a description of the courses in the degree.

Computer science is an exceptionally fast-moving field where knowledge is subject to rapid obsolescence and ideas progress swiftly from research to practice. The department therefore seeks to offer technical instruction that stays on the cutting edge of new developments while simultaneously providing each student with a core of intellectual tools that will never become obsolete. The department views skills in communication, mathematics, and algorithmic reasoning as central and the understanding of underlying principles as more important than familiarity with specific technical products. Still, direct hands-on experience is essential to mastering these skills and principles. If students are to be adequately prepared for careers in computer science, they should have extensive experience with machines and software that are state-of-the-art.

          "context": "Women in Computer Science | Apply to be a Mentor Apply to be a Mentee Overview: Beginning in Spring 2018, the Computer Science department will be addressing the issue of low representation of women in Computer Science through a series of departmental initiatives. The primary initiative is the creation of Women in Computer Science (WiCS). This organization is a social and professional group geared at helping to advance women in the department and the field at large through a departmental mentorship program, creating a network to connect students to alumni, and hosting monthly guest speaker and student social events designed to help support and connect students. The Need: In Fall 2017, there were 24.9% undergraduate females and 75.1% undergraduate males enrolled in the Computer Science department at Florida State University, or about a 1:3 ratio of undergraduate females to males. While this number is low, it is higher than the national average 17.9% of women who graduated with a Computer Science bachelor’s degree in 2016 (Zweben and Bizot, 2016). While the Computer Science field is booming, the number and proportion of Computer Science degrees earned by women has decreased in the past 10 years (National Science Foundation, 2017). In the Computer Science department at Florida State University, we do not settle for higher than the national average, and we are making equal representation in Computer Science a priority in our department. The underrepresentation of women in Computer Science raises the possibility that the field functions in a way that may prevent or hinder women from becoming a part of it (Pearl et al., 2002). Thus, it is pivotal that departments and organizations evaluate their internal practices to ensure women are receiving the support they need to enter and advance in the field. Women in Computer Science (WiCS): All students are welcome to join WiCS, even if they would not like to be a mentor or mentee. Monthly socials and guest speaker sessions will occur the second Wednesday of every month. Please keep up-to-date with the latest WiCS news by following us on Social Media ( Facebook ). WiCS Student Council: The Student Council is a group of undergraduate and graduate students interested in leading WiCS. The Student Council creates the agenda for monthly socials and guest speakers and helps to make executive decisions for the group. The WiCS Student Council also monitors and controls the Social Media pages for WiCS. Mentorship: Rationale: Research suggests there are four primary, interrelated obstacles for women in Computer Science: difficulties with self-esteem (imposter syndrome), lack of mentoring and role models, gender discrimination, and difficulties balancing career and family responsibilities (Pearl et al., 2002). It is well documented that mentorship programs help students to excel in STEM fields like Computer Science (Dennehy & Dasgupta, 2017), and are used at many colleges and universities that have higher-than-average women in Computer Science, like Carnegie Mellon (Frieze and Blum, 2002). Process: Mentees are paired with their mentors by the mentorship coordinator. Mentors are expected to reach out to their mentees within the first two weeks of receiving their mentees’ contact, and are expected to meet with their mentees at least once a month outside of the monthly WiCS meeting. The goal of these meetings are to build a rapport and offer support and resources to the mentee. Who can be a mentor or mentee? Students interested in becoming a mentor must meet the following requirements: Be an undergraduate or graduate, main campus student in the Computer Science department Taking or passed COP 4530, Data Structures Have a 2.7 or higher GPA Be willing to devote the time to being a mentor (estimated ten hours a month for a semester) Students interested in becoming a mentee must be within their first two years of the program, and not have taken COP 4530, Data Structures. In other words, students may be freshmen/sophomores or transfer students in their first year. Mentorships last for one semester. After this, mentors and mentees may opt out of the program or offer to extend their mentorship. Students of any sex or gender identity are welcome to apply. How to Become a Mentor or Mentee: Download the application on the website and email it to the program coordinator at advisor@cs.fsu.edu by the deadline printed on the application. Mentors will also need to complete an interview. Selected Mentors will be notified within a week of the interview if selected.

Unless following one of the two tracks listed below , the student should obtain written approval in advance from the department for the specific combination of courses used for the minor. Students must also satisfy stated prerequisites before enrolling in any computer science course. A grade of “C-” or better must be earned in each course counted toward the minor. What is a Minor? A minor in another subject is part of the requirements for a bachelor’s degree in certain departments. Unlike a major, a student does not need to be formally admitted to a minor, nor does the minor appear on the transcript. The Department and the Registrar do not have any forms to fill out or any way to register that a student intends to complete a minor in a particular subject. A student who has fulfilled the requirements for any given minor simply claims the minor when requesting a Graduation Check with their respective College. Documentation It is up to the student’s major Department or College if they require the student to complete a minor, to verify that the student has completed an acceptable minor. This can be checked using the lists below. Because the content of this web page may change in the future, it would be a good idea for a student to print out a copy of this web page at the point the student decides to do a minor, and save the copy for later verification of the minor. Approved Tracks The following SCIENCE TRACK is a rigorous set of courses (essentially the beginning of a computer science major) that is approved and recommended for the minor: Course Prerequisites COP 3014 (3) or COP 3363 (3)* MAC 1140 COP 3353 (1) or COP 3363 (3)* none COP 3330 (3) COP 3353 (co/prerequisite) and COP 3014 Plus two of the following: CDA 3100 (3) COP 3330 (co/pre) and MAD 2104 (co/pre) CEN 4020 (3) COP 4530 (co/pre) CIS 4360 (3) COP 3330 CNT 4603 (3) CGS 3406 or COP 3014 COP 3252 (3) COP 3330 COP 4342 (3) COP 3330 COP 4530 (3) COP 3330 and MAD 2104 and CDA 3100 (co/pre) COP 4710 (3) COP 3330 and MAD 2104 COP 4610 (3) COP 4530, CDA 3100 *COP 3363 combines COP 3014 and COP 3353; students may satisfy both requirements with this course. Students may not take both COP 3014 and COP 3363 and have them both count for the minor. The following GENERAL TRACK is also approved for the minor (this is the recommended track for Information and Management Sciences majors): Course Prerequisites Any beginning programming course from the following: Java: CGS 3416 (3) MAC 1105 C++: CGS 3406 (3) or COP 3014 (3) or COP 3363 (3) MAC 1105 (CGS 3406), MAC 1140 (COP 3014, COP 3363) Python: CGS 3465 (3) MAC 1105 Plus three of the following: A second beginning programming course listed above that is not in the same programming language. CGS 2060 (3) or CGS 2100 (3) [Credit will not be given for both courses] CGS 3066 (3) None COP 3502 (3) MAC 1105 CIS 4403 (3) or CGS 2930 (3)* [Any 3-hr course listed for Science Track minor in the previous table] None *COP 3363 combines COP 3014 and COP 3353. **Students may take either CIS 4360 OR CGS 2930 towards the General Track minor in Computer Science. Other sets of courses may be recommended for students in certain specific majors. As this department works out such recommendations they will be added to this web page.

          "context": "WHY MAJOR IN COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY | WHY MAJOR IN COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY About the Program Scientific discovery is the result of creative interplay between inductive and deductive reasoning. Computational models play an increasingly important role in deducing the consequences of explanatory models, yet biologists are routinely hindered by the limitations of models currently available as software. In part this results from a lack of interdisciplinary training in both biological and computational sciences. This program seeks to achieve two goals: 1) to develop an understanding of the issues associated with developing biologically meaningful computational models, and 2) to give students the broad-based education that is needed to create a set of models directed towards solving a practical biomedical problem. In the process, it is hoped that the student will learn how to meld biological and quantitative skills. Students participating in this degree program will be better positioned to develop productive careers in the burgeoning fields of computational biology and bioinformatics. Employment and Research Opportunities Employment opportunities for students with these skills can be found throughout industry, including the areas of healthcare, forensics and the pharmaceutical companies. As one might expect in an emerging field, even more research opportunities exist. Here are a few: the creation of biological algorithms and heuristics that are computationally efficient on serial and parallel computers; the analysis of the primary (sequence), secondary (folding), and tertiary (3-dimensional) structures of DNA, RNA and protein sequences; genomic diversity (the study of disease genes, variation, mutations, etc.); comparative genomics (whole genomes, genome structures, gene locations and function); genomic engineering; the development and application of theoretical techniques for the design of molecular medicine; analytical chemistry techniques or molecular biological experimental work, guided by computational structural analysis.",

Below are the minimum admissions requirements for the CC MS degree program: Required Degrees: To be admitted to the Department of Computer Science as a Cyber Criminology graduate student you should have an undergraduate BS or BA degree in Computer Science or BS degree in Cyber Criminology. The program is designed primarily for our BA Computer Science and BS Cyber Criminology undergraduate students who wish to continue on in the pursuit of their MS degree in this field. Students who do not meet these undergraduate degree guidelines will be required to complete certain undergraduate prerequisites before graduation with a graduate degree in Cyber Criminology. Students without a prior undergraduate or graduate degree in computer science should have at least completed COP4530 (Data Structures) or an equivalent class to be considered competitive for admissions. Here is the list of Undergraduate Prerequisites for the MS CC Degree Program. GRE Scores: The minimum GRE scores required for admission are a 145 on the verbal section and a 150 on the quantitative section. For the old scoring system, the minimum GRE score required for admission is 1100 (Verbal and Quantitative combined) with a minimum of 650 on the Quantitative. TOEFL Scores: The minimum required score on the IBTOEFL for admission consideration is 80 (213 computer-based, 550 paper-based). However, the Computer Science Department considers a score of 100-105 competitive, especially when students are seeking assistantships. The ability to lecture in English will be a major consideration in the selection of students for Teaching Assistantships. Grade Point Average: Students should have at least a B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) average to be considered competitive. Students with a GPA of less than 3.0 in their undergraduate degree fall below both the department and university standards.",

Because the systems field constantly sprouts new research domains with independent evolutions, it is crucial to develop solutions that resolve incompatible assumptions and requirements among multiple domains. His recent work, the Conquest file system, illustrates how performance improvement does not preclude system simplicity. His continuing work, Conquest-2, aims to conserve energy while improving performance at the same time. Andy is also the inventor of electric-field-based multipath routing for mobile ad hoc networks, which demonstrates how large-scale distributed coordination can be achieved without communication and maintaining states.

Limitation or removal of any of these authorizations from individual GFS-faculty is delegated to the unit level authority where such assignments are made. GFS Nomination Criteria: The Faculty member under consideration for nomination to Graduate Faculty Status must, subject to consideration of special circumstances, have (1) completed the doctorate in Computer Science (or its equivalent) and (2) proven expertise in the teaching area. GFS Limitations/Restrictions: Faculty holding GFS are expected to actively engage in graduate education through teaching, mentoring and research supervision. They should show evidence of research-based scholarship and/or creative work resulting in peer reviewed publications or equivalent work. A Computer Science faculty member may be restricted from any GFS responsibilities (e.g. the right to serve as the chair for a dissertation committee) if two-thirds of the faculty in the department who hold that responsibility vote to restrict that faculty member’s specific responsibilities. Faculty not in the FSU Computer Science Department have the right to co-direct dissertations, theses, or projects provided that they have GFS in another FSU department or hold a courtesy faculty appointment in the FSU Computer Science Department with co-directive status. Such a faculty member may lose the right to co-direct Computer Science graduate students if two-thirds of the FSU Computer Science faculty with GFS vote to restrict it. Specialized members of the Computer Science faculty and courtesy appointees may be nominated for Graduate Teaching Status (GTS) within the Computer Science Department. GTS allows a specialized faculty member or courtesy appointee to teach graduate courses. Persons in similar status may be nominated for Co-MDS and to be able to co-direct MS students on theses and projects. Non-tenure track faculty and courtesy appointees in the Computer Science Department are eligible for nomination to graduate teaching status (GTS) provided that they have received a PhD (or its equivalent), hold expertise in the teaching discipline, and have received a two-thirds majority vote in favor of appointment by the Computer Science faculty who currently have GFS or GTS within the department. Under exceptional circumstances specialized faculty members and courtesy appointees whose terminal academic degree is an MS, may be nominated for GTS to teach graduate courses within a specific area, on the basis of significant experience in that area and two-thirds of the Computer Science faculty with GFS or GTS vote to approve it. A Computer Science faculty member or courtesy appointee may lose individual GTS responsibilities (e.g. the right to teach graduate courses) if two-thirds of the faculty in the department who hold that responsibility vote to revoke it. All nominations must be approved by the Academic Dean and Dean of The Graduate School in accordance with university policy. Specialized faculty members in the Computer Science Department are eligible for nomination to obtain masters directive status (MDS) to direct MS students on theses or projects provided that they have received a PhD (or its equivalent) and have received a two-thirds majority vote in favor of MDS by the Computer Science faculty who currently have GFS or MDS. Courtesy appointees in the Computer Science Department are eligible for nomination to obtain co-masters directive status (MDS) to direct MS students on theses or projects provided that they have received a PhD (or its equivalent) and have received a two-thirds majority vote in favor of CMDS by the Computer Science faculty who currently have GFS or MDS. Approved and adopted by two-thirds majority vote of the faculty holding GFS in June 2009. Revision of GTS policy approved by two-thirds majority vote of the faculty holding GFS/GTS in November 2012. Revision of GTS policy approved by two-thirds majority vote of the faculty holding GFS in April 2015.",

Thus, the minimal admissions requirements are (1) an undergraduate GPA of no less than 3.0 and (2) a score of 1000 or greater on the combined verbal and quantitative portions of the GRE. Degree Requirements The initial track for the MS CC degree will be coursework only. The general degree requirements will include 3 graduate criminology courses, 6 graduate computer science (CS) courses related to information assurance and computer security and 1 additional criminology or CS course for a total of 30 hours. In addition, MS CC students will have to complete certain undergraduate prerequisites, shown below, before graduating, and will likely have to complete a subset of these courses before being admitted to the MS CC degree program. Note that CIS 4385 is required for the FSU BS in Cyber Criminology and the other four courses are required for the FSU BS in Computer Science and BA in Computer Science degrees. Undergraduate Prerequisites for the MS CC Degree Program: CDA 3101 Computer Organization II (3) CIS 4385 Cybercrime Detection and Forensics (3) COP 4530 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Generic Programming (3) COP 4610 Operating Systems and Concurrent Programming (3) COP 4710 Theory and Structure of Databases (3) The graduation requirements include completing all of the undergraduate prerequisites, completing 3 graduate criminology courses, and completing 6 graduate computer science courses.

          "context": "Differences between the BS and BA in computer science | Differences between the BS and BA in computer science Differences between the BS and BA in computer science The BS in Computer Science (BS in CS) is considered the science track and the BA in Computer Science (BA in CS) is considered the humanities track. Also the BS in CS degree is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org , and the BA in CS degree is not. The department encourages students to pursue the BS in CS if they are capable of completing it. We believe there will be more opportunities for BS in CS students after graduation, such as working for engineering and science firms. However, we do believe there will be significant opportunities for BA in CS students who are primarily interested in applications outside the sciences and engineering. The BA in CS is also an excellent track for students who are double majoring in another field outside the sciences and engineering. Because of reduced requirements in mathematics and theoretical computer science, the BA degree is not ABET accredited and students graduating with the BA in CS who wish to be admitted to the graduate program in CS at FSU may be required to take prerequisite undergraduate courses . This same policy is already in place for students who are admitted to graduate study in CS from other closely related majors, such as Mathematics and Computer Engineering. The BS in CS and BA in CS have the following differences in course requirements. MAC2312 (4) Calculus II, and MAD3105 (3) Discrete Math II are required for the BS in CS and are not required for the BA in CS. The probability course STA4442 (3) Introduction to Probability is required for the BS in CS. PHY2048C (5) General Physics I w/Lab and PHY2049C (5) General Physics II w/Lab are required for the BS in CS. In contrast, BA in CS students may instead satisfy the liberal studies science requirement by taking 7 hours of science courses from the approved list. COP4531 (3) Analysis of Data Structures and Algorithms and COT4420 (3) Theory of Computation, which have MAD3105 Discrete Math II as a prerequisite, are required for the BS in CS, but not for the BA in CS. The BA in CS will require 9 hours of humanities, which are not required for the BS in CS. The BA in CS will require additional hours of general electives that are not required for the BS in CS degree. The BS in CS has a collateral interdisciplinary minor. BA in CS students will likely need to select a minor in another subject, which could overlap with the 9 hours of humanities and/or the additional hours of general electives.",

          "context": "WHY MAJOR IN CYBER CRIMINOLOGY | WHY MAJOR IN CYBER CRIMINOLOGY About the Program An interdisciplinary undergraduate degree program in Cyber Criminology was offered by FSU starting in Fall 2007. This new degree program was developed jointly by the Department of Computer Science and the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Computer crime can be broadly defined as any criminal activity that involves the use of information technology. These crimes include illegally accessing information, intercepting data, damaging or deleting data, interfering with the functioning of a computer system, identity theft, etc. Information-related crime and computer/network security issues are already major concerns. These issues affect all levels of business, government, and academia and have grown in importance as most organizations link their networked computer environments to the Internet. A Cyber Criminology student will learn both how to use computers to facilitate the study of crime and will study how crimes are accomplished through the use of computers. Employment and Research Opportunities We anticipate there will be a significant demand for graduates of the Cyber Criminology program. It is well known that there is a shortage of information technology experts. Similarly, there is a pressing need for information technology specialists to handle issues related to information crime, cyberforensics, and computer/network security. However, there is also a need for computer skills for the prevention, detection, and study of all types of crime, whether or not they involve the use of information technology. Graduates of the program will be prepared to work either for law enforcement agencies as information crime specialists, within companies or organizations as network security specialists, or within academia and government to study the causes of crime and the best methods for its prevention.",

We offer financial support to new and existing PhD and MS students in the form of teaching assistantship (TA), research assistantship (RA), and fellowship. Each semester, a number of (typically 25-35 in the Fall and 5-10 in the Spring) best qualifying new students, identified by the admissions and financial aids committee, are offered financial support with admission. The department gives priority to students who were admitted with full financial support (20-hour TA/RA appointment or fellowship) and PhD students who were admitted without support, but have passed the PhD Preliminary exam. The general departmental policy is to continuously support such students in the Fall and Spring semesters (the department has very few TA positions in the summer) until they graduate, provided that sufficient funds are available. Typical duration of continuous support for Fall and Spring semesters is as follows. 6 years for PhD students who entered the program without an MS degree in CS 5 years for PhD students who entered the program with a CS MS degree 2 years for MS students Requirements for continuous TA funding support for PhD students For continuous TA support, PhD students have three levels of priorities: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3, with Tier 1 being the highest priority. As of Spring 2018, all students in all of the three levels of priorities are funded by the department (but this may change in the future). All students in any priority group for TA support must meet the following requirements: Making minimum satisfactory progress toward the degree as specified in this document . Satisfying all university requirements for being a teaching assistant, including passing the English speaking test for foreign students. Performing assigned duties (e.g TA/RA duties) satisfactorily and reliably. Informing the department in sufficient advance the desire to be supported and the commitment to the duties assigned by the department. A PhD Student who (1) was admitted with full financial support (20-hour TA/RA appointment or fellowship), or (2) was admitted without financial support, but has passed the PhD Preliminary exam, is in the Tier 3 priority group if the student meets the above requirements. A PhD student who meets the above requirements is in the Tier 2 priority group if the student is identified by a tenure-track faculty as a Tier 2 TA. A PhD student who meets the above requirements is in the Tier 1 priority group if the student is identified by a tenure-track faculty as a Tier 1 TA. The department maintains the tier-3 list. Tenure-track faculty must identify their tier-1 and tier-2 TAs by July 1 for the Fall semester and October 15 for the Spring semester. Requirements for continuous TA funding support for MS students MS students admitted with financial support are defaulted to the Tier 1 priority group for the same level of support when admitted. As of Spring 2018, all students in the priority group are funded by the department.

Aranya and Rebecca are in the NSF Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, directed by Dr. Mike Burmester. WiCyS is sponsored by National Science Foundation (NSF), federal agencies and academic partners. WiCyS continues to recruit, retrain and advance women in cybersecurity from academia, research, and industry all in the name of sharing knowledge, experience, networking, and mentoring other women. Aranya Ajith and Rebecca Powell will be talking about what reverse engineering is used for and mainly the difference between static and dynamic reverse engineering. An excerpt from their talk: “Reverse Engineering disassembles code to analyze its features, and understand weaknesses and exploits. It is a powerful tool for the programmer, the security analyst, but also for the adversary. For the programmer, to design better code; for the analyst, to understand its structure and potential malicious traits; and for the adversary, to  take control of the application. Dynamic analysis allows for the inspection of the behavior of the code as it runs: what processes it starts, what locations it attempts to access, while static program analysis is another semi-easy practical way of learning x86 and how it plays into malware analysis without having any risk of infecting the machine while still being able to  learn vital strings, host-based indicators, network-based indicators, etc. Understanding how to use these tools, and how to interpret the pseudocode, is the real challenge: it is hands-on and involves most of the effort. Understanding the theory is far less challenging.”",

He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from UC Davis in 2013. Prior to joining FSU, Dr. Hoang held post-doc positions at UC San Diego, University of Maryland, and UC Santa Barbara. Dr.  Hoang’s research area is cryptography, with a practice-oriented theme. His line of research aims to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of cryptography, giving products of genuine utility that are theoretically justified yet faster than heuristic solutions. For example, he has built a new authenticated encryption scheme AEZ to improve both security and speed of standardized schemes underlying Internet protocols such as HTTPS, IPSec, and WPA2. AEZ is currently a second-round candidate in the standardization competition CAESAR. Dr. Hoang’s research papers earned the Best Honorable Mention at EUROCRYPT 2015 and Best Paper Award at CCS 2015. Dr. Adrian Nistor joins the department this fall semester as an assistant professor. Dr. Nistor received his PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in May 2014. Prior to joining FSU, Dr. Nistor has been with the Computer Science Department at Chapman University as an assistant professor. Adrian’s research interests are in software engineering, with a focus on detecting, repairing, and preventing bugs in real-world applications. His current research projects investigate performance, concurrency, and mobile bugs. His techniques found more than 190 previously unknown bugs in widely used software, e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla, Google Core Libraries, GCC, MySQL, Ant, Lucene, Groovy, Tomcat, JUnit, JMeter, Log4J, Struts, etc. More than 140 of these bugs have already been fixed by developers based on Adrian’s and his collaborators’ reports. Adrian’s research includes empirical and analytical work, static and dynamic techniques, and bugs from various application types—client, server, mobile, and scientific applications. Dr. Nistor won an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper award at ICSE 2015. He received an NSF grant as a sole PI to investigate performance bugs that have non-intrusive fixes. He is a committer to Apache Collections. He published in ICSE, MICRO, ISSTA, MSR, and JDPC. Adrian collaborated with three PhD students, three master’s students, and seven undergraduate students. He is looking for highly motivated students to do research with at Florida State University!",

This project, titled “CICI:  RSARC:  DICE – Data Insurance in the Cluster Environment”, was awarded by the NSF directorate CISE:OACI. The abstract of the project is as follows: high-performance, distributed computing has become indispensable in solving complex scientific, engineering, and business problems. The integrity of the data generated and stored on computer clusters is of undisputed importance to scientific research and business intelligence, as compromised data can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions. Unfortunately, existing security mechanisms for high-performance and distributed computing systems are complex, inconsistent, insecure, and difficult to deploy. Many systems utilizing the current security mechanisms simply do not provide sufficient protection and remain vulnerable to even trivial attacks. For example, recent studies have found that thousands of unprotected database installations and computer clusters have been hacked. As such, there is a pressing need to improve the security of high-performance and distributed computing systems. This project develops a security framework for high-performance and distributed computing systems that employs strong modern cryptographic algorithms, and is easy to reason, deploy, and use without lengthy and error-prone configurations. The project consists of three major components: a container-based virtual cluster, a component to defend against side-channel attacks, and a secure execution ledger for auditing. The first component is the key to enabling authentication, authorization, and data protection for clusters without sacrificing usability or performance. The project team will build the virtual cluster based on the popular Docker container but enhance it with flexible key management, attack surface reduction, and security hardening, including defenses against side-channel attacks. Communications among nodes of a virtual cluster and I/O operations are transparently encrypted to protect the data in transition and at rest. The secure execution ledger provides a global holistic view of program execution in the whole system, allowing auditing the behavior of individual users as well as user groups. By tightly integrating these three components, the project seeks to achieve strong support for the four pillars of the cluster data security: authentication, authorization, auditing, and data protection.",

The activities of the FSU Vision Group focus on research in computer vision that are motivated by psychophysical data and neurophysiological findings. We emphasize that visual modeling is a fundamental problem in computer vision in that visual perception is nonlinear, which makes many of the tools critical for linear systems not applicable. We focus on models which may have great potentials for real-world problems. Research activities at Florida State Vision group are centered around visual information processing from human visual perception modeling, computational models and algorithms for perception problems, to real world applications. Visual information processing is a very complex phenomenon that is involved with prior knowledge stored in memory, modeling of the visual environment, and computation at a given moment of deriving a solution for the purpose of survival and decision making.",

His main research interests lie in applying the rich theory of algorithms to the domains of computational geometry, computer graphics, pattern recognition, and machine learning. The general theme that threads his research interests in algorithms is narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Theoretical computer science relies on making assumptions that do not generally hold in the real world. For instance, the performance of algorithms on real data vs worst case analysis, the assumption that all memory operations are unit cost, noise in the input, degeneracies, importance of exact solution to optimization problems are issues that seem to need attention but are mostly ignored by the theory community. Addressing some of these issues has been the focus of his research. His work on core sets illustrates why column generation methods perform well in optimization, both theoretically and experimentally. His work on surface and curve reconstruction gave very simple algorithms that were provably fast and could handle noise in the data. His research on cache oblivious algorithms showed why certain ways to analyze algorithms compared to the RAM model of analysis were better for practical purposes. He also worked on the design of a classifier for biometric and other applications. This classifier has also been used for palm identification using outlines of the human hand. The classifier was based upon ideas that came out from his research in optimization.",

This representative may not hood doctoral students. If a doctoral student attends his or her graduation ceremony, it is the responsibility of the major professor to be there to hood the student, or to arrange for another departmental faculty member to do it. Neither members of the graduation staff nor the departmental representative may hood, so don’t ask them to do it. (If the major professor absolutely cannot do the hooding, another member of the committee should be asked to do it.) The departmental algorithm for selecting a representative Repeat: The top person on the list who is not on leave and not hooding one of his or her students is the designated departmental representative. This person (hereinafter called the “designee”) has the responsibility. It is perfectly acceptable for the designee to allow another faculty member (not otherwise obligated in the graduation ceremony) to substitute. Credits are updated after each semester, and the new ordered list is formed by inserting the people with new counts back into the list . A person whose priority changes goes to the back of the list within a given category. Otherwise order within each priority is unchanged. Credit is issued for either being departmental rep or hooding 1 or more students. New faculty go to the back of the priority 0 sub-queue in the order in which they formally accept a position. Note 1: Each semester, the department is asked to submit in writing the name of the designee. Note 2: The list was initialized as follows: For those with priority > 0, the order is by time since entering that category.

The project is a collaborative effort between FSU and a colleague from Michigan Technological University. The aim of the project is to support separate asynchronous execution lanes where dependencies between instructions in different lanes are statically identified by the compiler to provide inter-lane synchronization. As implied by its name, the SCALE approach has the ability to scale to different types and levels of parallelism. The goal is to meet or exceed the performance of a traditional superscalar processor while approaching the energy efficiency of a very long instruction word (VLIW) processor. The award includes funding for FSU in the amount of $600,000. For more information, please visit: FSU researcher receives NSF funding to make higher-performing computer apps",

The problem of synthesizing specifications of undefined procedures has a broad range of applications, but the usefulness of the generated specifications depends on their quality. The paper contributes a technique for finding maximal and non-vacuous specifications. Maximality allows for more choices for implementations of undefined procedures, and non-vacuity ensures that safety assertions are reachable. To handle programs with complex control flow, the technique discovers not only specifications but also inductive invariants. The iterative algorithm lazily generalizes non-vacuous specifications in a counterexample-guided loop, where the key component is an effective non-vacuous specification synthesis algorithm. The approach has been implementedÃin a tool called HornSpec, taking as input systems of constrained Horn clauses and experimentally evaluated on a range of public benchmarks.",

The success of formal methods has enabled widespread applications in ensuring the correctness, safety, and reliability of computing systems. This project on automated word-level synthesis will provide a core utility for diverse applications since the bitvector representation of various computing systems is well-suited for both hardware designs and low-level software. By virtue of the underlying formal reasoning, the programs synthesized by the automated methods are guaranteed to be correct-by-construction, thus improving their quality and improving developer productivity. The two application domains targeted in this project – computer networks and systems-on-chips form the core components of the computing infrastructure that provides numerous products and services of interest to society. The research activities will involve training and mentoring graduate students, and the development of teaching material. Real-world applications that require bit-precise reasoning for synthesis and verification, such as in the domains of computer networks and hardware, remain challenging in terms of performance and scalability. One main reason is that existing techniques for synthesis over bitvectors rely largely on a translation of multi-bit words down to bits, called bit-blasting, which destroys the high-level structure in the application programs. This project aims to improve the automated synthesis of word-level bit-precise programs, with applications in network packet processing and verification of systems-on-chip (SoCs). The core research activities will include the development of a new approach to word-level synthesis. The synthesizer will be guided by word-level quantifier elimination over bitvectors without bit-blasting. It will also leverage the well-known framework of Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS), where the search for a program is guided by domain knowledge captured in the form of context-free grammars, program sketches, and partial specifications comprising input-output examples. The project will develop suitable grammars and synthesis methods in two application domains: (1) synthesis of code for programmable network switches from high-level packet processing programs, and (2) synthesis of verified architecture-level abstractions from hardware designs of accelerators and processors in modern SoCs. These will improve techniques for code generation (from high-level to low-level programs) and verified abstraction (from low-level to high-level programs), respectively.

The grant comes from the Directorate for Computer Information Science & Engineering (CISE).  She continues the growing list of recent faculty and staff to be funded for their various research efforts here at the university. The title of her project is “Text Retrieval in Software Engineering,” and the goal is reshape the use of TR (text retrieval) aspects in software engineering. This project will encourage the use of more TR based techniques in a the day to day task of software developers. Nowadays, there is simply too much textual information located in software artifacts for humans to process. With this work, the TR configuration in software engineering applications will be transformed to be able to perform queries that can in turn present the best TR configuration for each individual software engineering application. Sonia received a Ph.D.  from Wayne State University in Detroit, MI and before that, studied her undergraduate years at Babes-olyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. She has numerous accolades including the ACM SIGSOFT CAPS travel award in 2012. Her most recent publications have landed her many presentations including the ACM Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity in Pittsburgh this year. Congratulations to Sonia once again on her  NSF grant and her continued pioneering for text retrieval information.",

One of the papers, titled “Identity-based Format-Preserving Encryption,” is a joint work between Prof. Viet Tung Hoang and Prof. Mihir Bellare (UC San Diego). The paper studies the NIST standard proposal DFF of Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE), a method to encrypt credit-card numbers and legacy databases. DFF is used by Veriphone, and claims security even when some local devices are compromised. The paper formalizes the security notions that DFF is meant to offer, proves that DFF indeed meets those goals and suggests further security enhancements. The other paper, titled “Hear Your Voice Is Not Enough: An Articulatory Gesture Based Liveness Detection for Voice Authentication,” is a joint work among Linghan Zhang, a third year PhD student in the department, and her lab-mate Sheng Tan, and her advisor Prof. Jie Yang. In the paper, they proposed VoiceGesture, a mobile voice liveness detection system on smartphones. It detects voice spoofing attacks by extracting user-specific features that resulted from the articulatory gesture when a user speaks a passphrase to a smartphone. VoiceGesture is practical as it requires neither cumbersome operations nor additional hardware but a speaker and a microphone that are commonly available on smartphones. Experimental results show that VoiceGesture achieves over 99% detection accuracy at around 1% Equal Error Rate (EER).",

The ARO is the Army Research Office which grants awards for innovative research on mobile wireless security. Professor Yang joined the Florida State computer science faculty after receiving his Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology in 2011. His research interests include cyber security and mobile computing, with an emphasis on wireless security, smartphone security and applications, location systems, mobile healthcare and vehicular applications. For his first current project, Professor Yang will seek to exploit the capabilities of WiFi technology in order to capture changes in the environment and human beings. These capabilities open the door for a range of monitoring including things such as human breathing, heart rates, and daily activities. This is research that can have a substantial impact in healthcare, as it frees the individual from active monitoring by a license professional or other forms of wearable monitoring systems. Something as complicated as detecting the onslaught of a disease can be as simple as a few innovations to existing WiFi infrastructures. As Yang states, “The proposed WiFi-enabled wellbeing monitoring not only advances and extends the applications that could be supported by WiFi networks but also enables easy and large-scale deployment in non-clinical settings due to the proliferation of WiFi networks.” The 2nd award is to finish the third year of a three year project to find new ways to deliver securable data across hostile military environments. This all to prevent eavesdropping from oppositional forces in combat along with other potential uses. Once again Yang states, “The proposed research work highlights the importance of new paradigms for securing wireless systems that takes advantage of unique physical properties to thwart security threats without requiring overhead to wireless devices.” Once again congratulations to Dr. Yang for his outstanding research efforts.",

Amended by vote of the faculty via a secret ballot in November 2019.\nAmended by vote of the faculty via a secret ballot in February 2020.\nPreamble\nThe faculty of the Florida State University Department of Computer Science has drafted and adopted these Bylaws in order to define a set of principles, organizational structures, and procedures that will enable the smooth and effective operation of the department in furtherance of its mission.\nThe department bylaws adhere to and are consistent with University policies found in the FSU Constitution, the BOT-UFF Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Faculty Handbook, and annual Promotion and Tenure letter.\nEach faculty member has an equal responsibility in furthering the academic goals and in maintaining the academic excellence of our department. This will be achieved in an atmosphere of collegiality and constructive cooperation.\nIn modifying departmental operations, faculty and staff members are expected to be familiar with and follow the Florida State University Substantive Change Policy as found on the FSU Regulations web site.\n1 Voting Membership\nThe Computer Science faculty is defined as follows:\nTenure-track faculty: consisting of those employees having tenure in the Department of Computer Science or those who are earning time creditable towards tenure in the Department of Computer Science;\nSpecialized faculty: consisting of those individuals in faculty classifications that are not tenured and not earning time creditable towards tenure, who are appointed as full-time employees of the department or are full-time employees of the FSU Panama City Campus primarily teaching Computer Science courses.\nThe Voting Membership of the department is defined as the Department Chair and all the members of the Computer Science Faculty for whom the Department Chair approves the annual Assignment of Responsibilities (AoR) and Annual Evaluation. In addition, any other members of the Computer Science Faculty who hold tenure in the department are entitled to vote on matters related to promotion and tenure, including tenure criteria and recommendations to grant promotion and tenure, and on amendments to the Bylaws.\n2 Faculty Meetings and Voting\nFaculty meetings are typically called by the department chair, but may also be called by petition to the department chair of four voting members. In the latter case, the meeting is to be held within one month. Minutes will be kept and shall be made available to members. At the request of any voting member, Robert’s Rules of Order shall be invoked.\nExcept where these Bylaws specify a different procedure, decisions made by the faculty will be by a vote conducted at a faculty meeting, by letter ballot, or by e-mail ballot. For a faculty meeting, one half of the Voting Membership that are eligible to vote on the measure under consideration constitutes a quorum, and passage of a measure requires a majority of the Voting Membership that is present and eligible to vote on the measure. Passage of a letter or e-mail ballot requires a majority of the Voting Membership that is eligible to vote on the measure. Except where these Bylaws specify differently, all the Voting Membership is eligible to vote.\nIn addition to whatever other matters are proposed for vote at a faculty meeting, the following matters shall be subject to approval by vote of the faculty as described:\nCurricular changes involving creation, deletion, and modifications of requirements for majors, certificate programs, and degree programs.\nThe entire Voting Membership is eligible to vote on these issues, except that for graduate curriculum issues only members with graduate teaching status are eligible to vote.\nCreation and termination of degree programs and their majors require approval by a two-thirds supermajority of the eligible Voting Membership.\nPrior to sending the Dean of the College a recommendation for an offer of new employment in a faculty position, the department chair will conduct a poll of the Voting Membership. For tenure track positions, only members of the tenure-track faculty are eligible to vote in the poll. \nIn addition, recommendations regarding offers of new employment with tenure, and offers of new employment at the ranks of Associate Professor or Professor, shall be subject to the same balloting processes specified in 4.1 (Promotion and Tenure Committee) for internal candidates for tenure and promotion to the respective ranks.\n3 Administrative Officers\n3.1 Department Chair\nThe department chair is the chief administrator of the department. The department chair shall be appointed by the Dean of the College. All other department administrative positions and committees will be appointed by the department chair, with the exception of the Faculty Evaluation Committee, the Promotion and Tenure Committee, and the Department Chair Selection Committee, which are formed in accordance with the provisions as described in Section 4. The department chair will ensure that all department members are informed on matters of policy.\nThe chair is responsible for annually making and signing Assignments of Responsibilities, and writing Annual Evaluation letters. The Annual Evaluation by the chair will take into account the results of the peer evaluation performed by the Faculty Evaluation Committee and the contents of the FEC binder. Each year, the chair shall write a progress towards promotion letter for each faculty member who is not promoted to his/her highest rank when such a letter\nis not provided by the P & T committee. The progress towards promotion letters may be combined with the Annual Evaluation letters.\nThe term of the department chair is three years. In the third year of a department chair’s term a Department Chair Selection Committee will be elected and will recommend to the Dean a slate of department chair candidates for the next term, as described in 4.2.2 (Department Chair Selection Committee). If the department chair position becomes vacant before the end of a term, the same process will be invoked as needed to fill the vacancy.\nThe department faculty may recommend to the Dean that the department chair be removed from office. Such action must be taken according to the following procedure. (a) A petition calling for removal must be signed by a majority of the tenured faculty members and submitted to the Dean. (b) The Dean or his/her representative shall preside at a meeting of the faculty to consider the petition. The department chair will not attend. Two weeks notice shall be given for this meeting. (c) To be adopted, a motion for removal must be supported by 2/3 of the members eligible to vote for the department chair in a secret ballot. This process shall be conducted by the department executive committee (without the department chair), which shall report the vote to the faculty and to the Dean.\n3.2 Other Administrative Officers\nOther faculty may be appointed by the department chair to assist the department chair in administration of the department, and given responsibilities delegated by the department chair. In performance of such delegated responsibilities, these faculty members shall act with the administrative authority of the department chair.\n4 Administrative Committees\nThese Bylaws establish and define the responsibilities of certain committees. Some of these committees are elected by the faculty; the others are appointed by the department chair. In addition to these committees, the department chair may create and appoint additional administrative committees for specific purposes. Except as specified otherwise in these Bylaws, committee members will come from the Voting Membership of the department. The chair of an elected committee is elected by the committee members. The chair of an appointed committee is appointed by the department chair.\n4.1 Promotion and Tenure Committee\nRecommendations for faculty promotion and tenure are made by the Promotion\nand Tenure (P & T) Committee. The Promotion and Tenure (P & T)\ncommittee\nconsists of all faculty members who are voting members in the department\nand who are eligible to vote in some promotion and/or tenure\ncases as described in the following. For tenure cases, only tenured\nfaculty vote. For tenure-track faculty promotion to a given rank, only\nthe faculty at that rank or above vote. For specialized faculty\npromotion to a given rank, only tenured faculty and the specialized faculty\nat that rank or above vote. Some common cases are the following.

A\nfaculty member is encouraged to ask the P & T Committee at the\nbeginning of\nthe Spring semester to provide advice regarding whether or not\nhe/she should\ngo forward\nfor promotion and/or tenure. The P & T Committee will use\nthe FEC Binders\n(see 4.2.3) for purposes of providing this advice. The preparation of the\nnomination binder is initiated as per FSU University policies and\nprocedures.\nThis binder is reviewed by the P & T Committee who will vote on a\nrecommendation decision before the binder leaves the department.\nThe P & T Committee will elect a chair from their members who must be a\ntenured full professor. The P & T committee is responsible for the required\npre-tenure reviews. The P & T chair will be responsible for soliciting\nletters if required for pretenure reviews of assistant professors and for\nwriting the actual review that will be submitted for approval by a majority\nof P & T Committee members.\n4.2 Elected Committees and Offices\nThe elected committees are the Department Chair Selection Committee, the Executive Committee, and the Faculty Evaluation Committee.\n4.2.1 Committee Election Procedure\nElection of committee members for the Department Chair Selection Committee, the Executive Committee, and the Faculty Evaluation Committee shall be conducted at a meeting of the faculty.

Elections shall be conducted by a faculty member chosen to serve as Secretary for the occasion by the department chair. Voting shall be done by secret ballot in a meeting of the faculty called by the department chair and announced to the faculty at least two weeks in advance.\nElection of members of the committee shall be one at a time in the following manner: The Secretary calls for nominations from the faculty. Once nominations are made, a vote is taken to elect one member of the committee from those nominated. A member of the committee must be elected by a majority vote of the faculty present at the meeting. This process is repeated sequentially for each of the membership slots. In case no nominee obtains a majority, a runoff is held between the nominees with the highest two vote counts (not necessarily distinct) on the previous ballot. If, after repeated ballots, the tie still holds, the tie is resolved as follows: The person who has served most recently on the committee loses (i.e., is not elected for membership); secondarily, the person of lower academic rank loses; tertiarily, the person with fewer years of employment at FSU loses. In cases where these rules do not resolve a tie, the Secretary may attempt to elect committee members by unanimous agreement among himself or herself and the faculty members involved in the tie.\n4.2.2 Department Chair Selection Committee\nA new committee is elected either early in the final year of a term of a sitting department chair, or when the department chair position becomes vacant before the end of a term.\nFour members of the Department Chair Selection Committee shall be elected from the Computer Science faculty.

Included in this work are the development of fault-tolerant network protocols, quality of service issues, and reliability in end-to-end performance for the transfer of very large data sets. The corresponding infrastructure must be both cost-effective and robust.\n",

Graduate teaching assistants are given a wide variety of responsibilities and duties in their assistantships. This handbook will attempt to introduce the new TA to the computer science department as well as to provide the experienced TA with a set of resources to aid in teaching classes at FSU.\nRelationship of Teaching Assistant to Faculty Supervisor\nEvery teaching assistant is assigned a supervisor. In the case of TA’s who are grading, teaching recitation sections, or serving as mentor for a distance learning section, that supervisor will be the lead instructor for the course. If the course has only one lecture, the lead instructor will be the lecturer for that course. If the course has multiple lectures, one of the lecturers is designated as the lead instructor for the entire course.\nThe relationship between TA and supervisor depends on the whether the TA is is a grader, a recitation instructor, or a full-responsibility classroom teacher.\nGrader:\nSupervisor writes course syllabus and sets grading policies.\nSupervisor schedules TA office hours, to coordinate with other sections of the same course and to fit the available office hour space time slots.\nSupervisor introduces TA to class, and includes TA contact info. on syllabus.\nSupervisor plans the assignments, perhaps in collaboration with the TA.\nSupervisor goes over answers and grading scheme with the TA prior to grading.\nSupervisor spot-checks TA grading results.\nSupervisor checks that TA keeps reasonable office hours, and gets work back to students in a timely fashion.\nSupervisor may ask TA to attend lectures and take attendance at lectures.\nSupervisor calculates and assigns final grade.\nTA grades work, and submits it to supervisor (sorted by grade).\nTA assists supervisor in proctoring examinations\nRecitation Instructor:TA is responsible for all of the items for Grader. In addition, the following apply:\nSupervisor discusses a lesson plan for each recitation meeting with the TA.\nSupervisor attends and critiques some sample of the recitation sections, say at least 1/4 of them.\nSupervisor checks that TA arrives on time for all recitation meetings.\nTA is required to attend all lectures given by the Supervisor.\nRecitation instructors should approach their supervising instructor, before the start of the term, to inquire about the instructor’s wishes as to the content and form of the recitation. The department does not expect any recitation to consist of simple question and answer sessions, and under no circumstances should the TA decide to cancel a recitation or allow the students to leave early because the TA has “nothing to do”. Unless the Supervisor specifically commands otherwise, all TAs should prepare a semi-formal presentation emphasizing the difficult and/or important points covered in recent lectures. The format can be quite varied, of course (whatever works); e.g. problems to go over, having the students write collective code, re-stating concepts etc. If you feel you are not getting appropriate guidance from the supervising instructor, please approach the instructor first, then come and see the Associate Chair.\nOn the first meeting of each class, both the supervising instructor (or lecturer, if the course has multiple lecturers) and the TA should be present to be introduced to the class.\nFull-Responsibility Classroom Teacher:TA is responsible for all of the items for Recitation Instructor. In addition, the following apply:\nTA writes syllabus, prior to start of each term, and seeks approval from supervisor.\nTA writes all homework assignments and examinations, and submits them to supervisor for approval, prior to giving them to the class.\nTA calculates and assigns final grades, and submits them to supervisor for review and approval.\nSupervisor reviews syllabus with TA prior to start of term.\nSupervisor meets with class once at the start of the term, to be introduced by the TA as the person to whom students should address any disputes with the TA.\nSupervisor reviews and approves all homework assignments and examinations, before they are given.\nSupervisor attends and critiques at least one class meeting.\nFor the relationship between the faculty supervisor and the teaching assistant to be most effective, discussions concerning the course should begin several weeks before the beginning of the semester. (Remember: TA’s and faculty are on the payroll for at least two weeks prior to the start of every term, and are expected to use that time for class preparation and organization.) The discussion of the course should include the syllabus, the policies of the course, how students will be evaluated, etc.. Since faculty members are typically very busy, the responsibility for initiating the discussion will fall on the shoulders of the TA.\nAs a TA gains more experience teaching a given course and establishes a working relationship with a given faculty supervisor, the supervisory relationship may be “loosened”, at the discretion of the faculty supervisor. However, ?he TA should be prepared to accept closer supervision and direction if assigned to a new course and/or supervisor.\nProgram for Instructional Excellence Conferences\nTeaching assistants are required to attend one of the Program for Instructional Excellence teaching conferences each year. PIE attempts to offer workshops that will benefit both the new and the returning TA. These conferences are held in the Fall and the Spring semesters, a few days before the beginning of each semester. For more information regarding these conferences, contact the Program for Instructional Excellence, 408 Westcott, 644-8844.\nOffice Hours\nAll teaching assistants must set up office hours and be available during those hours for student meetings. Typically, for every hour spent in the classroom, the TA will have one office hour. Therefore, if the TA teaches a three credit hour class, she will schedule three hours in her office during the week. It is best to stagger these times somewhat to allow students with varying schedules to be able to drop by. If there are students who have conflicts with the scheduled hours, the TA should be flexible in setting up alternative meeting times. Failure to hold office hours, or failure to show up is a very serious matter.\nNormally, the department provides individual desks for TA’s, in shared offices, in convenient locations. However, we cannot always do that. Recently, the entire university population has been growing faster than new buildings are being constructed, so we find ourselves very cramped for space. Therefore, for Fall term 2001, most TA’s (especially graders) will be required to share a desk with another TA, and nearly all will have their offices in a bullpen area. In such cases, since conversations in a shared area would be disturbing to other occupants of the office, TAs are encouraged to hold office hours in one of the department’s teaching labs or other space set up by the department for office hours. To find out what shared spaces are available for holding office hours in any given semester, ask your faculty supervisor, the Laboratory Manager, the Associate Chair, or the Department Chair.\nFor courses with multiple sections, the supervising instructor of the course (there is only one per course) is responsible for assigning office hours to TA’s so that the hours of different TA’s do not overlap. For such courses, all TA’s will hold offices hours in a single place, designated by the supervising instructor. All TA’s will be responsible for answering questions of students from any section of the course.\nSUSSAI\nAny TA who spends time in the classroom is required to administer the SUSSAI (student evaluation of teaching) forms EVERY semester that they teach. For courses with different people doing the lectures and recitations, the forms must be administered separately, for both recitations and lecturers.\nVideotaping\nTA’s who spend time in the classroom are required to be videotaped. Arrangements can be made through the department’s Teaching Associate. Once videotaped, the TA may request that the Teaching Associate, someone from PIE or someone else from the department view the videotape and make constructive suggestions concerning improvements that may be made.\nSupervisor Evaluation of Teaching Assistants\nEach teaching assistant will be observed in the classroom environment by the faculty member supervising the course. The faculty supervisor will fill out an evaluation form and should discuss that form with the TA after the observation. In addition, all TAs with classroom responsibility are required to administer SUSSAI for every semester of teaching. The SIRS forms are not returned to the TA until the following semester and will be examined by the Associate Chair of the department at that time. The Associate Chair is available for discussion of SUSSAI forms. Because these forms are not returned until after the end of the semester, they are of little use in correcting problems the TA may be currently experiencing. The Program for Instructional Excellence offers Teaching Analysis By Students (TABS), which are similar to SUSSAI, but are administered at midterm and returned within a week. To find out more about TABS, contact the Teaching Associate or PIE (644-8844).\nThe department uses the faculty supervisor evaluation forms and SUSSAI to select recipients of the Departmental Outstanding Teaching Assistant Awards. Students who meet all of the following requirements are eligible:\nMust be in good standing with the University;\nMust be currently enrolled and actively pursuing a graduate degree in computer science at FSU;\nMust have had full classroom teaching responsibility for a class offered by the computer science department in the previous spring and/or fall semester.\nThe TA evaluation committee (comprised of department faculty) will form a ranking of the eligible TAs by composite SIRS from the previous spring and fall, use supervisor evaluation forms to confirm the ranking formed above, seeking additional supervisor input as needed, present the rankings with supporting data to the TA evaluation committee for discussion and approval, and choose the top candidate(s) from this ranking for Outstanding Teaching Awards. At least one award is to be given each year, and up to 25% of the eligible TA’s in a given year may be chosen for awards. Note that those who have graduated or left the University since the teaching was performed are not eligible for awards. TAs may receive multiple Departmental Outstanding Teaching Assistant awards throughout their tenure at FSU. There is no distinction among new TAs, TAs with longer teaching records, Masters students or PhD students. Therefore, all eligible TAs compete as equals for the awards.\nThe University also presents a number of Outstanding Teaching Assistant awards each year, through the Program for Instructional Excellence. The TAs must be nominated by either their students or members of their departments. They are then asked to fill out an award application and submit letters of recommendation from their peers, students and graduate professors as well as sample SIRS forms and a copy of a syllabus. Nominees’ applications are rated on how well the TAs organize their subject matter, how available and accessible they are to their students and if there is evidence that they show respect for their students regardless of race, religion, and sex. A TA may receive only one University-wide Outstanding Teaching Assistant award in his or her tenure at FSU.\nTeaching Assistant Ranks & Responsibilities\nTeaching assistants in computer science may receive appointments which require a variety of tasks. A TA may be a lead TA, that is, assigned primary classroom responsibility for a particular course. The TA may be assigned to teach the recitation sections of a programming class. Finally, a TA may be assigned grading duties under the guidance of a faculty member. TA’s assigned to grading duty are typically required to also monitor one of the undergraduate computer labs in the department. The standard appointment for an assistantship is twenty hours per week, although at times, TA’s may be asked to do more than this. If the TA is a lead TA, twenty hours per week translates to two three-hour classes (usually 2 sections of the same class).\nJob descriptions for each level of assistantship along with the compensation for that level is listed below.\nThree-tier Assistantship Model\nThe department currently has a graduated scale where pay amount is based on experience, level of responsibility, and other factors. The three main classifications of graduate stude?t assistants are described below.\n1. Lead TA – Full Responsibility Classroom Teacher\nQualifications: At least 18 hours graduate work and preferably a M.S. degree in CS. One year of teaching experience in CS.\nResponsibilities: Full classroom responsibility, supervised by Department Chair or Associate Chair (typically two sections of the same 3-hr course), or senior system administrator (must have two years system manager experience).\n2. TA – Recitation Instructor\nQualifications: Degree in CS or another field with at least 18 hrs in CS at the junior or senior level.\nResponsibilities: One of the following:\ntwo 2-hr recitation sections of same course, including grading for that course, plus supplemental grading or lab hours (5 hrs/week). High level of faculty supervision.\ntwo 1-hr recitation sections of same course (including grading) plus supplemental lab hours (8 hrs/week). High level of faculty supervision.\nsystem administrator\nDepartmental project assignment, supervised by Associate Chair\n3. Graduate Assistant – Grader\nQualifications: Bachelor’s degree in some field with at least 12 hrs in CS at the junior or senior level.\nResponsibilities: Twenty hrs per week of grading/lab work, where a grading assignment for a course counts as 5 hrs/week.\nSince there are only a certain number of slots of each category available, it is possible that a person qualified for a lead TA or a TA position may be offered a lower position. If this is the case, the compensation and the duty assignment would correspond to that lower position.\nIf a person is in a TA position and is asked to perform lead-TA duties, pay will be given at the higher rate for that term with no implication that the student will stay at the higher rate permanently. In continuing years, students will be considered for upward moves in the 3-tier plan without any formal application process. Evaluations by the Chair, the Associate Chair, and the TA Evaluation Committee will play a significant role.\nIf there are no recitation sections available for a TA, the student will be given the option of taking pay at the lower level and performing grad assist duties, or the student may elect to provide additional service to maintain the higher rate of pay. Examples would be as follows:\n20 hrs/lab plus one grading, or\n13 hrs/lab plus two gradings\nOccasional special assignments may require adjustments in assignments and pay, but a student will never be forced to take less pay than was originally offered by the assistantship.\nResources for Teaching Assistants\nCopying\nThe department has a variety of equipment and other resources available for use by teaching assistants. At the beginning of each semester, TA’s with classroom responsibility will receive a course id number that may be used on the copy machine located in the computer science office. All copies to be made for a class can be done using this id and will be charged to that particular course. This copier id can also be used to print materials on the various laser printers around the department so that the TA’s personal page count (200 pages per semester) is not exhausted by materials for the course.\nOverheads\nThere are several overhead projectors that can be reserved for use in the classroom. There is a reservation sign-up sheet inside the department administrative office suite, 203 Love. One can also get blank overhead slides that will work in the photocopy machine from the office staff for preparing your lectures.\nThe department also has cart-mounted portable computer and projection machine available for use in order to do application demonstrations in classes that do not have such equipment built in. These materials can?be reserved by contacting the Systems Group (system@cs.fsu.edu).\nVideos\nMany of the classes that are taught by teaching assistants may benefit from the showing of videotapes on a wide variety of topics. For example, the department has the PBS series “The Machine that Changed the World” available on videotape. To reserve a tape (or to peruse the list of tapes available), see Jennifer Reed in 203 Love.\nSyllabi of Previous Classes\nThe department maintains a book of syllabi prepared for classes in the past. Teaching assistants are invited to look at these to get ideas about what the department expects in a syllabus and also to get ideas about what is to be covered in a particular course. See Martha Snyder to take a look at past syllabi. It should be noted at this point that all syllabi for the department are required to contain a statement announcing that reasonable accommodations can be made for students with disabilities and particular needs. If you have questions about this statement, see the Teaching Associate or Associate Chair.\nCS Department Web Site\nThe department maintains much information online at http://www.cs.fsu.edu/. Lists of faculty and their office hours, software and hardware available on the department system as well as information about funding, jobs and fellowships can be accessed on the web site.\nBooks on Teaching\nThe Program for Instructional Excellence has a large library of books and other materials concerning all aspects of teaching. These books are available for borrowing to all teaching assistants. To find out more about these materials, contact the Departmental Teaching Associate. In addition, the department has some materials available for perusal. To see these, contact Jennifer Reed in 207 Love.\nEvaluation Services\nTeachers can administer bubble sheets for testing and have them graded by Evaluation Services in the Johnson Building. This service allows analysis of individual questions according to the number of students who got the question right or wrong and how well they did on the rest of the test.\nIn addition, Evaluation Services provides a free electronic gradebook program. One can receive a copy of this program by simply bringing a disk to Evaluation Services to put the copy on. If the teacher then decides to use the bubble sheet testing, student grades can be recorded on disk by Evaluation Services and then loaded directly into the electronic gradebook.\nWorkshops\nThe department maintains a close relationship with the Program for Instructional Excellence. PIE offers a variety of workshops concerning various aspects of teaching at FSU. These workshops include those offered at the University-wide Fall and Spring Teaching Conferences as well as others offered throughout the year. Topics in the past have included: Active Learning, Retaining Minority Students in the Sciences, and Writing to Learn. TAs in the computer science department are required to attend one of the two teaching conferences each year and are strongly encouraged to attend the other teaching workshops.\nTeaching Associate\nIn conjunction with PIE, the department may have a Teaching Associate available for consultation with TAs. The Teaching Associate provides a wide variety of services including videotaping, office hours for discussion of teaching issues, organization of the peer observation program and planning meetings to discuss various aspects of teaching within the department. For more information about becoming a Teaching Associate contact the Associate Chair.\nProblems That TAs Encounter\nTeaching assistants in every department will encounter some difficulties during the course of their duties. Some of difficulties will be unique to the department while others are fairly universal. The list of potential problems presented b?low is by no means a comprehensive list but attempts to prompt the TA to think about some problems and how to deal with them before the problems arise.\nCheating\nCheating is an uncommon but extremely difficult problem. In computer science, it can be especially difficult to deal with on program assignments. It is relatively easy for someone to simply copy another student’s program, change a few variable names and pass the program in as one’s own. If the program works correctly, this is extremely difficult to detect. It is even more difficult to detect cases where a student has a friend or hired tutor work on the program.\nIf you think you have detected a case of similar-looking programs you should ask the student to meet with you. If this is your first time dealing with cheating, you may want to first seek advice from the Associate Chair or Department Chair. You should explain the situation and ask the student to explain why the two programs are so similar. Many times, the problem is simply one of misunderstanding. Students do not realize that working so closely on the program is cheating whereas discussing ideas and approaches to solutions is encouraged. It will be up to your judgement to determine whether to treat the infraction as a formal case of cheating or to just give the student a warning.\nIn any case where cheating is suspected, you should always preserve all the evidence, in case the case needs to be treated as a formal honor code violation or in case the student ignores a warning and continues the behavior.\nCheating on homework, including programming assignments, is sometimes hard to to detect. However, it will generally result in the student not achieving the learning objectives of the assignment. Examinations should be written in a way that if undetected cheating on programs does occur on an out-of-class assignment, and the learning objectives of the assignment are not met, the student will not pass the examination.\nFurther, it is a departmental policy for courses involving programming assignments or other out-of-class work that are taught by TA’s that the final course grade cannot be higher than “D+” unless the supervised (examinations and supervised in-class exercises) grade average is “C-” or higher. The course syllabus should state this clearly.\nThe department’s formal policy for dealing with any type of cheating when it is detected is to ask the student to sign a letter acknowledging that she or he has violated the academic honor code, accepting a specified academic penalty, and accepting the warning that any further violation for this course will result in a specific academic penalty. A typical academic penalty for a clear case of intentional cheating is reduction of one letter grade for the course. The principle to keep in mind in deciding on a penalty is that it must be severe enough to serve as a disincentive for cheating. Thus, for example, if a student’s grade would have been “F” anyway, it would be no penalty at all if you just assign a final grade of “F”; instead you may stipulate that the student also is not to retake the course with the grade forgiveness option.\nIf the student signs the letter, it should be delivered to the Associate Chair or Department Chair. If a student is not willing to accept the academic penalty, the case should be sent up to the Associate Chair or Department Chair to start formal proceedings.\nIf one student comes to the teaching assistant to accuse another student of cheating, the accusing student must be made aware that in order for any action to be taken on the accusation, that student must be willing to have his or her name known to the accused student. Without this acknowledgement, the department and the University have no choice but to drop the matter, unless the instructor is able to find other, independent, evidence of the cheating.\nFinally, you should stress the department’s resolve?to come down very hard on cheating and your own resolve to check for cheating, on the first day of class and whenever thereafter you feel is appropriate. Cases of cheating must be brought to either the Chair or Associate Chair of the department, and you should tell your students that even if the TA chooses to simply give a 0, for example, the department may on its own institute formal proceedings.\nExaminations for Students with Disabilities\nThe only condition under which students will be allowed to take examinations in the SDRC (Student Disability Resource Center) for courses given by this department is if there is an employee of the department (faculty, TA, or staff) present to proctor the exam. It will be the responsibility of the student to arrange a time that is convenient for the instructor for the student to take the exam.\nDrop & Add Period\nThe Department has a policy of dropping students who did not attend the first class of a term. At the first meeting of the term you should take roll, compare the roll against the official class roster (obtainable on the department’s computer system) and pass on to the Academic Coordinator a list of the students who did not attend the first class.\nDuring the drop/add period (the first four days of the semester), many students will beg, plead, cajole, do whatever they can to get into some of the classes taught by the computer science department. If the course has a cap on the number of students, the teaching assistant has final say as to whether to raise that cap. TAs should bear in mind that some caps cannot be raised because there are fire code limits on the number of people allowed in certain classrooms. Other caps are in place because a course will be partially taught in one of the computer labs and there are a limited number of PCs in these labs. These caps may be raised at the discretion of the TA but bear in mind that, for example, although there are a given number of PCs in each literacy lab, at any given time, several of them are not working. Raising the cap of a computer literacy class beyond the number of PCs in the lab, then, will make the class difficult for all involved.\nProbably the easiest way to deal with students attempting to add a class is to take a list of names on the first day of class, allowing students to mention any extenuating circumstances (graduating senior, etc.). Instruct the students to then check with the Academic Coordinator of the department about trying to get into the class. Give the list to the Academic Coordinator and advise her if there are students on the list that you think should definitely be in the class if there are openings. After those students are allowed into the class, the rest of the openings should be filled on a first come, first served basis (that is, first to come to the Academic Coordinator).\nSyllabus\nThe syllabus is the most important piece of paper(s) the TA will hand out all semester. It represents a contract between the students and the TA. As a result, the syllabus should contain as much information about the course as possible. All policies for the course should be explicitly stated in the syllabus including how students will be evaluated. A list of textbooks and other materials needed for the course should be included. The TA should include his/her office hours on the syllabus as well as a phone number where she/he can be contacted. In the computer science department, it is useful to also include an e-mail address. Important dates, such as for the midterm and final examinations, should be listed. In short, if the syllabus is a good one, it will head off many potential problems by laying the rules out for?everyone to see at the beginning of the semester. It is also a good idea to verbally highlight the important points on the first or second day of class. Information that is communicated in two ways is more likely to be retained than if it is communicated in only one way.\nEach teaching assistant is required to have her/his syllabus reviewed by his/her supervisor, and then file two copies of his or her syllabus with the Academic Coordinator (as of last editing, this is Jennifer Clark) in the computer science office prior to the start of classes each semester. These syllabi will be available for review in future semesters by other TA’s teaching the same course.\nThere are several specific items that must be included in the syllabus, including the following:\ninstructor’s name, office location, telephone number, e-mail address, and office hours\nthe textbook(s) and any other required reference materials: The choice of textbook must be approved by the departmental curriculum committee. If a TA believes the textbook for a course should be changed, the TA should bring the matter up with the Associate Chair or Department Chair.\ndates of examinations, include the final examination: It is a departmental policy that final examinations are required in all undergraduate courses. It is university policy that final examinations shall be given only during the final examination time specified for the course in the Schedule of Classes. Note that this rules out “take home” final examinations.\nsummary or outline of the educational objectives and topics to be covered by the course: Two different things are required. The objectives are different from topics. Objectives are stated in terms of what the student should be able to do to pass the course. For example, “recognize, define, and correctly use, the terminology of operating systems” and “apply commonly used synchronization primitives to write correct multithreaded systems” might be objectives of an OS course, and and “design, code, document, test, and debug an Internet application program written in Java” might be an objective for a course in Java programming. In contrast, topics are more like the titles of lectures or textbook chapters. For example, “virtual and hierarchical memory”, “process scheduling”, and “synchronization primitives” might be topics in an OS course.\nstatement of attendance policy: The FSU General Bulletin says: “Students are expected to attend all of their scheduled University classes. The University reserves the right to deal at any time with individual cases of nonattendance. The effect of absences upon grades is determined by the instructor. Arranging to make up work missed because of legitimate class absence is the responsibility of the student. A student reported for excessive absence in any course may be required by the academic dean to drop the course with the grade of “F”. Students reported absent for a period of two weeks or more may be readmitted only by permission of their academic dean. Upon readmission the dean may require a reduction of the academic load.” The Faculty Handbook amplifies this policy: “The faculty member is expected to check attendance in all classes. The faculty member is expected to make some allowance for absence occasioned by illness, by trips for the University, or by authorized field trips. Any arrangement to make up work because of class absence is the responsibility of the student. The effect of absence upon grades is determined by the instructor; at the beginning of the term the faculty member explains the grading policy to the students. Class attendance for student athletes will be monitored by BOR rule and verified to the Registrar’s Office.” For lower level courses it may be especially beneficial to base a portion of the grade — as much as 10% — on attendance, ? so as to discourage students from skipping class.\nstatement of grading policy: This should be consistent with the departmental policy about out-of-class work not making the difference between a passing (C- or better) and failing (D+ or lower) grade.\nstatement on accommodation for disabilities: This should be the standard “boiler plate” provided by the department, which as of the last editing of this handbook was as follows:Students with disabilities needing academic accommodations should:\nRegister with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC).\nBring a letter to the instructor from the SDRC `indicating you need academic accommodations. This should be done within the first week of class.\nThis syllabus and other class materials are available in alternative format upon request.\nFor more information about services available to FSU students with disabilities, contact the Assistant Dean of Students:\nStudent Disability Resource Center\n08 Kellum Hall\nFlorida State University\nTallahassee, FL 32306-4066\ne-mail: sdrc@admin.fsu.edu\nphone: (850) 644-9566.\nstatement on honor code violations and penalties: This should be consistent with the Student Handbook and departmental policies. For example, the following text is acceptable:As in any class at F.S.U., it is your responsibility to read, understand, and conform to the Academic Honor Code as set forth in the University General Bulletin and the Student Handbook. Any violation of these policies, especially involving plagiarism or the giving or receiving of help on any assignment, will result in severe penalties. Penalties include a grade of F with no provision for retaking the course under the forgiveness policy, and proceedings before the honor court.By turning in work for a grade in this course you are representing it as being entirely your own individual work. Unless otherwise specified in writing, all homework and programming projects are individual work. If any assignment permits teamwork, it will be explicitly stated so in the assignment, and then the work is required to be only the work of the people on the team.What does “individual work” mean? An intelligent person searches publications (including the web) for information, ideas, and code. If you use information or ideas obtained from the work of another person you must at least give credit via comments in your code stating what you have used, where you obtained it, and who is the person to whom credit is due. If you use any code written by another person you must first obtain permission from the author or copyright owner, then mark the beginning and end of the quoted code using appropriate comments, and include a comment giving where you found the code and the the name of the author or copyright holder. Failure to follow these rules will be considered a violation of the Academic Honor Code.Every test, quiz, computer program or other project turned in by a student must include the following affidavit (this is to forcefully remind each student of the policy). Modify it as shown for tests/programs.I hereby attest that I have neither given or received any assistance (in the completion of this project, or during this test). I fully understand that with regard to any work done at this university, the violation of this policy can result in a zero on the (project, or test), an F in the course, and possible expulsion from the university. \n_________________________\nSignature?\nstatement on classroom decorum: Include a statement about behavior in the classroom. In particular, emphasize that disruptions are cause for expulsion from the classroom.Side conversations, cell phone use, and other disruptive or distracting behavior are not permitted in the classroom. Violators may be expelled from the room, and repeat violators may be expelled permanently.\nIf this is your first time writing a syllabus, check with your faculty supervisor for assistance.\n",

          "context": "Women in Computer Science | Computer Science\n\nApply to be a Mentor  Apply to be a Mentee\nOverview:\nBeginning in Spring 2018, the Computer Science department will be addressing the issue of low representation of women in Computer Science through a series of departmental initiatives. The primary initiative is the creation of Women in Computer Science (WiCS). This organization is a social and professional group geared at helping to advance women in the department and the field at large through a departmental mentorship program, creating a network to connect students to alumni, and hosting monthly guest speaker and student social events designed to help support and connect students.\nThe Need:\nIn Fall 2017, there were 24.9% undergraduate females and 75.1% undergraduate males enrolled in the Computer Science department at Florida State University, or about a 1:3 ratio of undergraduate females to males. While this number is low, it is higher than the national average 17.9% of women who graduated with a Computer Science bachelor’s degree in 2016 (Zweben and Bizot, 2016). While the Computer Science field is booming, the number and proportion of Computer Science degrees earned by women has decreased in the past 10 years (National Science Foundation, 2017). In the Computer Science department at Florida State University, we do not settle for higher than the national average, and we are making equal representation in Computer Science a priority in our department. The underrepresentation of women in Computer Science raises the possibility that the field functions in a way that may prevent or hinder women from becoming a part of it (Pearl et al., 2002). Thus, it is pivotal that departments and organizations evaluate their internal practices to ensure women are receiving the support they need to enter and advance in the field.\nWomen in Computer Science (WiCS):\nAll students are welcome to join WiCS, even if they would not like to be a mentor or mentee. Monthly socials and guest speaker sessions will occur the second Wednesday of every month. Please keep up-to-date with the latest WiCS news by following us on Social Media (Facebook).\nWiCS Student Council:\nThe Student Council is a group of undergraduate and graduate students interested in leading WiCS. The Student Council creates the agenda for monthly socials and guest speakers and helps to make executive decisions for the group. The WiCS Student Council also monitors and controls the Social Media pages for WiCS.\nMentorship:\nRationale:\nResearch suggests there are four primary, interrelated obstacles for women in Computer Science: difficulties with self-esteem (imposter syndrome), lack of mentoring and role models, gender discrimination, and difficulties balancing career and family responsibilities (Pearl et al., 2002). It is well documented that mentorship programs help students to excel in STEM fields like Computer Science (Dennehy & Dasgupta, 2017), and are used at many colleges and universities that have higher-than-average women in Computer Science, like Carnegie Mellon (Frieze and Blum, 2002).\nProcess:\nMentees are paired with their mentors by the mentorship coordinator. Mentors are expected to reach out to their mentees within the first two weeks of receiving their mentees’ contact, and are expected to meet with their mentees at least once a month outside of the monthly WiCS meeting. The goal of these meetings are to build a rapport and offer support and resources to the mentee.\nWho can be a mentor or mentee?\nStudents interested in becoming a mentor must meet the following requirements:\nBe an undergraduate or graduate, main campus student in the Computer Science department\nTaking or passed COP 4530, Data Structures\nHave a 2.7 or higher GPA\nBe willing to devote the time to being a mentor (estimated ten hours a month for a semester)\nStudents interested in becoming a mentee must be within their first two years of the program, and not have taken COP 4530, Data Structures. In other words, students may be freshmen/sophomores or transfer students in their first year.\nMentorships last for one semester. After this, mentors and mentees may opt out of the program or offer to extend their mentorship.\nStudents of any sex or gender identity are welcome to apply.\nHow to Become a Mentor or Mentee:\nDownload the application on the website and email it to the program coordinator at advisor@cs.fsu.edu by the deadline printed on the application.\nMentors will also need to complete an interview. Selected Mentors will be notified within a week of the interview if selected.\nReferences:\nPearl, A., Pollack, M.E., Riskin, E., Thomas, B., Wolf, E., & Wu, A. (2002.) Becoming a computer scientist.

          "context": "Load Requirements for Graduate Students | Computer Science\n\nLoad Requirements for Graduate Students\nRules of the College and University\nCertain rules are imposed on the department from higher authorities.\nStudents in the thesis master’s program or a Ph.D. program must register for thesis/dissertations credits each term in which a substantial amount of work is being done on the thesis/dissertation, even if the minimum of six (6) semesters hours of thesis has already been met. Students who have left the campus must register for at least two (2) semester hours of thesis or dissertation credit per term “so long as they are receiving faculty supervision.” [page 72 of the Graduate Bulletin]\n“Returning students who … have been out of school for two or more consecutive terms (including the summer term) must submit an application for readmission to the readmissions section of the Office of the University Registrar. This application must be submitted at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the term for which readmission is desired.” [Graduate Bulletin ]\nAny international student on a visa who still claims to be a student is required by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service to be a full time student except on their last semester, and they can only have one last semester.\n“Twelve (12) semester hours per semester constitutes a full-time load for graduate students and fellowship holders. A student who wishes to register for fewer than twelve (12) semester hours must have written approval from the academic dean prior to registration.” [Graduate Bulletin]\n“Nine (9) semester hours is defined as a full-time load for graduate assistantship holders on a quarter-time appointment or larger. Academic deans may grant exceptions to this policy for teaching assistants in those departments which conform to national course load policies in their disciplines. To satisfy the residence requirement, however, a doctoral student must be enrolled for twenty-four (24) semester hours during any period of 12 consecutive months.” [Graduate Bulletin]\n“The [maximum] number of hours which a graduate student may carry without special permission is fifteen (15). A heavier load may be permitted by the academic dean.” [Graduate Bulletin]\n“Students must register for at least one (1) semester hour of thesis or dissertation credit in the final term in which a degree is granted. Nonthesis-type master’s program students who have not previously registered for the comprehensive examination must do so the final term.” [ Graduate Bulletin]\n“To be eligible for Matriculation and Out of State waivers this summer, TAs and RAs must carry the following minimum course loads during the terms indicated:\n13-week Session A\n9 hours\n6-week Sessions B or C (must be appointed for .50 FTE)\n5 hours\nCombination of A & B or A & C terms\n9 hours\n” [Memo from the Dean of Arts & Sciences, 8 March 2002]\nAdditional Departmental Rules\nThe Department of Computer Science imposes the following additional student course load requirements. Since Summer 1997, the department checks registrations of graduate students, and cancels them if they do not meet the department’s requirements.\nThe department extends the University policy about thesis/dissertation hours to include students who are working on a master’s project. That is, a student who is using University resources or taking up the time of a faculty member is required to register for at least 2 hours of thesis, dissertation, project, or DIS.\nThe department formally recognizes only three categories of registration: Full Time, Part Time, and FEOTABD (means “Fully Employed, Out of Town, and All But Document”, see definitions below).\nIn short, only full-time students are entitled to any of the following departmental resources:\nSpace allocation of any kind\nTelephone service\nWorkstation (dedicated or shared)\nPrinting service\nCopy service\nAccess to departmental expense funds, for example to support travel\nPartial relaxation of this policy (items 1, 2, 3 on an as-available basis and items 4, 5 only for research-related material) may occur in summer, as long as the resources are otherwise unused, and for FEOTABD PhD students returning to finish a dissertation.\nThe three categories, the required loads of students, and the privileges of students in each category are explained in more detail below.\nThe Categories\nFull Time\nThis category consists of all graduate students who are not in either of the other two categories. All TAs and RAs are in this category.\nPart Time\nThis category consists of graduate students who have been formally admitted to part time status. The admitting paperwork must reside in the student’s advising folder.\nTo be admitted to part time status, the student must submit a memorandum to the department chair, in writing or email, containing the following items :\nA request to be admitted to Part Time status\nA statement that the applicant is employed full time as a computer professional\nThe name of the employing entity and location\nThe employment supervisor’s name, address and phone number\nFEOTABD\nThis category, “Fully Employed, Out of Town, and All But Document”, consists of graduate students who meet ALL of the following criteria:\nAll requirements for the degree have been completed, except for the defense of the document (Dissertation, Thesis, or Project)\nNo on-campus services will be used, except for interaction with university personnel on the day (or two) of the defense\nComputing facilities may be accessed remotely, but no on-campus services such as printing, library, major professor office or other space use, etc, are expected to be used.\nThe Requirements\nFull Time students must register for nine (9) hours of graduate computer science credits each Fall and Spring semester and five (5) hours each summer semester in which they are using FSU facilities.\nPart Time students must register for three (3) hours of graduate computer science credits each semester in which they are using FSU facilities.\nFEOTABD students must register for one (1) hour of Dissertation, Thesis, or Project every semester.\nOne Exception\nIn the last semester, a student may register for as little as two hours. Note, however, that a student may have only one last semester. In the event that the student invokes this exception one semester and does not complete that semester, it cannot be repeated the following semester.\nFellows\nMany fellowships have load requirements that are higher than our departmental requirements. In such cases, the fellowship rules supersede those of the department.\nSpecial Rules for Summer Only\nIf you are not on assistantship/fellowship, then\nIf you are not using ANY university resources (including access to faculty), then you are not required to register at all. Most people who are in the middle of a thesis, project, or dissertation are not likely to be in this category since you will be continuing your contact with your major professor.\nIf you are using some type of resources, then you need to register for something. If working on a thesis or dissertation, you should register for at least 2 hrs of thesis/diss. If working on a project, you should register for at least one hour of project. If not doing any of the above, you should register for something (e.g., a class or maybe a DIS). This could be as little as 1 hr. In particular, this means it is OK if you want to just sign up for one course this summer (if not on waivers).\nRemember that if it’s your last term, it is OK to register for as little as 1 hr (1 hr of thesis, diss, or project) … plus only whatever else you need to graduate.\nIf you have any questions about this, please contact the Director of Graduate Studies.\n",

It provides a systems view of computing, emphasizing the interdependence of design, object orientation, and distributed systems and networks, from basic software through systems design. This major develops core competencies in programming, database structure, computer organization, and operating systems. It allows opportunities to study a range of other aspects of computer and information science, such as information security, data communication/ networks, computer and network systems administration, theoretical computer science, and software engineering. Every student can expect to become proficient at programming in C , C++, and Assembly Language. Additionally, students will be exposed to other languages such as Java, C#, Ada, Lisp, Scheme, Prolog, Perl, and HTML. This major is available on campus or through Distance Learning.\nThe CS/BA program is intended to allow students flexibility in combining computing with other interests. The BA program requires 9 hours of humanities/history beyond General Education requirements. Students in this program should meet with an advisor to select a minor from an approved list. The CS/BA is not ABET/CAC accredited and is not intended to provide sufficient preparation in computer science theory for graduate work in computer science.   \nNote to prospective transfer students: Prospective transfer students should contact as-admissions@fsu.edu (Arts & Sciences Admissions) with specific questions about admission and mapping requirements. \nInternet Supported Distance Learning\nThe programs available through internet-supported distance learning are degree programs that enable students with an Associate in Arts (A.A.) degree from a Florida public institution to earn an FSU bachelor’s degree without moving to Tallahassee. The programs are designed for part time study. Each student receives access to a course Web site and the e-mail addresses of everyone associated with the class. A unique feature of the distance learning programs is the support FSU provides through an assigned Mentor. Mentors serve as learning guides, helping to facilitate each individual student’s success. Students interact with each other, their Mentors, and their instructors via e-mail, Web-based discussion pages, and telephone calls. Students interested in Distance Learning should contact the Office of Distance Learning (ODL). For more information contact (877) FLSTATE or visit the web at https://distance.fsu.edu  .

The milestones listed to the right of each term are designed to keep you on course to graduate in four years. The Sample Schedule serves as a general guideline to help you build a full schedule each term. The General Education and Elective courses must be selected to satisfy all area, lab, and multicultural requirements unless your program meets these requirements with major courses. Milestones are courses and special requirements necessary for timely progress to complete a major. Missing milestones will result in one of two types of map registration stops. The first level (Degree Map Off-track) is placed following grade posting if the student has missed a milestone (course and/or GPA) for the first time in the major. If a student is in non-compliance with milestones for two (2) consecutive semesters (excluding summers), a Major Change Required stop is placed on the student's registration.\n Mapping Coordinator: Shellie Camp  Email: scamp@fsu.edu Sample Schedule Term 1 hrs ENC1101 Freshman Composition3MAC1105 College Algebra or higher3GE Core Social Science3GE Natural Science3GE Core Humanities3Milestones 1Complete ENC 1101 ( ≥C minus)Complete MAC 1105 or higher math ( ≥ C minus )Term 2 hrs ENC2135 Research, Genre, and Context 3MAC1140 Pre-Calculus Algebra 3GE History3GE Core Natural Science and Lab4Milestones 2Complete ENC 2135 ( ≥C minus )Complete MAC 1140 ( ≥ C minus )Recommend GPA ≥ 2.50Term 3 hrs COP3363 Introduction to C++ for majors or COP3014 Programming I3COP3353 Intro to UNIX (if COP 3014 is taken instead of COP3363)1MAC1114 Analytic Trigonometry3GE Ethics3Minor course3Milestones 3Recommend Minimum GPA ≥ 2.65Term 4 hrs MAC2311 Calculus I 4CS Elective 3GE Elective                      3Minor Course 3Milestones 4Complete MAC 2311 ( ≥ C minus )Recommend Overall GPA ≥ 2.65Term 5 hrs COP 3330 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Genetic Programming I3MAD 2104 Discrete Mathematics I3Foreign Language I4Minor Course 3Milestones 5Complete COP 3014 or COP 3363 ( ≥ C minus )Civic Literacy requirementRecommend Overall GPA ≥ 2.50Term 6 hrs CDA 3100 Computer Organization I3CS Elective 3Foreign Language II4Minor Course 3Milestones 6Complete COP 3330 ( ≥ C minus )Recommend Overall GPA ≥ 2.50Term 7 hrs COP 4530 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Generic Programming II3CS Elective 3CS Elective 3Foreign Language III4Milestones 7Pre-Graduation CheckRecommend Overall GPA ≥ 2.50Term 8 hrs CEN 4020 Software Engineering I3CEN 4090L Software Eng.

The milestones listed to the right of each term are designed to keep you on course to graduate in four years. The Sample Schedule serves as a general guideline to help you build a full schedule each term. The General Education and Elective courses must be selected to satisfy all area and multicultural requirements unless your program meets these requirements with major courses. Milestones are courses and special requirements necessary for timely progress to complete a major. Missing milestones will result in one of two types of map registration stops. The first level (Degree Map Off-track) is placed following grade posting if the student has missed a milestone (course and/or GPA) for the first time in the major. If a student is in non-compliance with milestones for two (2) consecutive semesters (excluding summers), a Major Change Required stop is placed on the student's registration. \nThe CS-Math/FSU-Teach major is designed for students who wish to teach Math and/or Computer Science at the middle and/or secondary education levels. Students are strongly encouraged to have credit for College Algebra (MAC1105) prior to enrolling as freshman in the CS-Math/FSU-Teach major. This degree should not be used by someone planning to do graduate work in computer science.\nIn order to be admitted for the second major in Education, students must have an overall 2.50 or higher GPA, and satisfy the teacher education admission requirements noted here: https://education.fsu.edu/teacher-ed-admissions\nThis program is limited access. Students must earn a 2.50 GPA to be accepted into the program.\n Mapping Coordinator: Shellie Camp Email: scamp@fsu.edu Sample Schedule Term 1 hrs ENC 1101 Freshman Comp3MAC 2311 Calculus I4GE Humanities & Cultural Practice3GE Social Science Core3SMT1043 Step 1: Inquiry Approaches to Teaching1Milestones 1Complete ENC1101 ( ≥ C minus )Complete 1st GE Mathematics ( ≥ C minus )Term 2 hrs ENC 2135 Research, Genre, and Context 3MAC 2312 Calculus II4COP 3363 Intro to Programming\t3GE Ethics3SMT1053 Step 2: Inquiry-Based Lesson Design1Milestones 2Complete ENC2135 ( ≥ C minus )Complete 2nd GE Math ( ≥ C minus )Minimum Overall GPA ≥ 2.50Term 3 hrs STA 2122 Applied Statistics3COP 3330 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Genetic Programming I3GE Elective/E-series3GE Natural Science Core\t3GE Natural Science Core Lab1SMT 3100 Knowing and Learning 3Milestones 3Complete General Knowledge FTCEApply for formal admission to STEMinimum Overall GPA ≥ 2.50Term 4 hrs GE History3Foreign Language I4MAD 2104 Discrete I3CDA 3100 Computer Organization I3GE Elective/Diversity3Milestones 4Complete MAC 2311 ( ≥ C minus )Minimum Overall GPA ≥ 2.50Summer hrs Foreign Language II4COP 3252 Java Programming3Term 5 hrs COP4530 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Generic Programming II3MAS 3105 Linear Algebra3CS 4000-level Elective3SMT 4301 Classroom Interactions3HIS3505 Perspectives on Science and Mathematics3Milestones 5Complete COP3363 or COP3014 ( ≥ C minus)Complete SMT 3100Recommend beginning Foreign Language requirementCivic Literacy RequirementMinimum Overall GPA ≥ 2.50Term 6 hrs MAT 3503 Functions and Modeling3MTG 4212 College Geometry3CEN 4020 Software Engineering\t3RED4335 Content Area Reading for Secondary School Teachers3ISC 3523C Research Methods3..Summer.TSL4324 ESOL Instruction in the Content Area3GE Elective3Milestones 6Complete MAD2104 ( ≥ C minus )Complete CDA3100  ( ≥ C minus )Overall GPA ≥ 2.50....Term 7 hrs SMT4664 Project Based Instruction (meets Oral Communication)3CS 4000-level Elective3BA History/Humanities3BA History/Humanities 3CEN 4090L Software Engineering Capstone1Milestones 7Complete SMT4664 ( ≥ C minus )Complete SMT4301 ( ≥ C minus )Complete a Pre-Graduation CheckProfessional Ed. & Subject Area FSCETerm 8 hrs SMT 4930 and SMT 4945 Apprenticeship Teaching 6Milestones 8Apply for graduation in 1st two weeksOverall GPA ≥ 2.50 Employment Information Representative Job titles Related to this Major: Middle School/High School Advanced Placement Mathematics Teacher, Middle School/High School Advanced Placement Computer Science Teacher, Programmer, Technical Support Representative, Manager, Sales Representative for Computer or Software Manufacturers, Technical Writer, Systems Analyst, Operations-Research analyst, Software Engineer, Webmaster, Data Processing System Manager, Network Administrator.\nRepresentative Employers: Public and private schools, government organizations, private industry, computer firms. \nInternational Opportunities: International study is available for all students and may include opportunities for internships or taking course work towards various majors and minors.

This generally includes meeting periodically with the ACM officers to plan their activities.\nHonors Day Organizer (Honors ) ()\nThis individual is responsible for organizing the annual departmental Honors Day activity each spring. This should be held near the end of the spring term, before the end of classes.\nDistance Learning Liaison (ODDL) (Lacher)\nThis individual is responsible for ensuring that the department is kept informed of developments at ODDL, and vice versa. In situations that call for representing the position of the department on a particular issue, the Liaison should consult with the department chair, who may in turn call a faculty meeting or e-mail poll, in order to develop a departmental position on the issue.\nComputer Engineering Liaison (Eng)()\nThis individual is responsible for ensuring that the department is kept informed of developments in the Computer Engineering Program of the FSU/FAMU COE, and vice versa.

Because this is also a course offered for credit, the job involves both service and teaching.\nAn important guiding principal is that the buck stops with the colloquium chair. To the extent that one delegates, one has to be vigilant that the delegated duties are carried out. For example, if a speaker shows up at the airport and no one is there to greet him, the department gets a black eye and the colloquium chair is responsible.\nCollect info from faculty about desired speakers to invite.\nInvite speakers.\nNotify the publication STATE so the talk will be given publicity. An e-mail address for such is in STATE (the FSU newsletter).\nArrange overnight accommodations.\nArrange for speaker to be picked up and returned to the airport.\nArrange a room for the talk.\nIf there is an honorarium to be paid, work with the CS office manager well in advance of the visit to fill out forms to arrange for that.\nWell in advance of the visit, have the CS staff person in charge of travel forms make up a TAR form to cover the speakers expenses.\nSend e-mail to faculty and grads announcing the talk the end of the week before the talk, and the day of the talk.\nArrange for the speaker to be entertained. Typically this would involve getting up a group to take the speaker to lunch, and getting up a group to take the speaker to dinner. Sometimes a faculty member will volunteer to entertain the speaker at his/her home.\nWhile the speaker is here, take the speaker by the CS staff person responsible for travel to provide social security number and sign the reimbursement forms to receive payments for travel expenses.\nMaintain a Colloquium web page and arrange to have it linked off the CS dept pages. Example web pages from the Spring 2000 Colloquium series, done by Dr. Levitz, can be seen at http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~baker/dept/colloquium_2000/index.html\nManage the Colloquium class; that is, the group of students taking Colloquium for credit. Guidelines for this can be found at the URL:\nhttp://www.cs.fsu.edu/~baker/dept/colloquium_2000/inst_to_students.html\n",

The milestones listed to the right of each term are designed to keep you on course to graduate in four years. The Sample Schedule serves as a general guideline to help you build a full schedule each term. The General Education and Elective courses must be selected to satisfy all area and multicultural requirements unless your program meets these requirements with major courses. Milestones are courses and special requirements necessary for timely progress to complete a major. Missing milestones will result in one of two types of map registration stops. The first level (Degree Map Off-track) is placed following grade posting if the student has missed a milestone (course and/or GPA) for the first time in the major. If a student is in non-compliance with milestones for two (2) consecutive semesters (excluding summers), a Major Change Required stop is placed on the student's registration.\nThe Computer Science Department degree program provides a broad background in programming, theoretical computer science, hardware, mathematics, physics, and science. The Computer Science (BS) major is limited access. Students must achieve at least a 2.65 GPA in all college work attempted. Students must then maintain a 2.50 GPA to remain in good standing in the major. Students starting math at a level below calculus will graduate with more than the minimum 120 hours needed for the degree but will not be considered \"off-course\".

The committee is responsible for oversight of the graduate curriculum, including approval of new course proposals, modifications to existing courses and textbook choices for all graduate courses. The committee is also responsible for proposing changes to degree program requirements and for new graduate degree and certificate programs to be approved by the faculty.\nOrganization: The committee will be comprised of members of the faculty and staff of the Department of Computer Science. The Chair of the Department will appoint members to the committee and assign a Chair. Committee members will solicit and gather issues for discussion from faculty, staff and students and call meetings on an “as-needed” basis. Minutes will be kept and recommendations made to the Chair of the Department in writing. All proposed curriculum changes, other than those that are truly minor, shall be published to the Computer Science Faculty for consideration, discussion, and voting at a CS faculty meeting. Minority reports may be attached to committee proposals by any member of the committee.\nMember Responsibilities:\nCommittee Chair: The Department Chair will appoint The Chair of the Committee. The Committee chair shall call meetings, assign individuals to sub-committees, and establish procedures and guidelines for the assessment of individual topics assigned to the subcommittees.\nCommittee Members: Each person assigned as a member of the committee shall participate in meetings called by the Chair of the Committee. It is the responsibility of each member to make recommendations to the committee on potential curriculum modifications and to keep abreast of current computer science and university curricula.

It provides an applications view of computing, emphasizing the interdependence of programming, object orientation, and software design and engineering. This major develops core competencies in programming, data structures, software engineering, and computer organization. It allows opportunities to study a range of other aspects of computer and information science, such as web programming, mobile programming, cybersecurity, digital forensics, databases and data engineering, data communication and networks, computer and network systems administration, computer systems, and theoretical computer science. Every student can expect to become proficient at programming in C++/C, and Assembly Language. Additionally, students may be exposed to other languages such as Java, Python, C#, Objective-C, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, CSS, HTML, and Scheme. This major is available on the Tallahassee campus only.\nThis major is intended to allow students flexibility in combining computing with other interests. This major requires 9 hours of humanities/history beyond General Education requirements. Students in this program should meet with an advisor to select a minor from an approved list. The Computer Programming and Applications major is not ABET/CAC accredited and is not intended to provide sufficient preparation in computer science theory for graduate work in computer science. \n*Note to prospective transfer students: Prospective transfer students should contact as-admissions@fsu.edu (Arts & Sciences Admissions) with specific questions about admission and mapping requirements.\nInternet Supported Distance Learning\nThe programs available through internet-supported distance learning are degree programs that enable students with an Associate in Arts (A.A.) degree from a Florida public institution to earn an FSU bachelor’s degree without moving to Tallahassee. The programs are designed for part time study. Each student receives access to a course Web site and the e-mail addresses of everyone associated with the class. A unique feature of the distance learning programs is the support FSU provides through an assigned Mentor. Mentors serve as learning guides, helping to facilitate each individual student’s success. Students interact with each other, their Mentors, and their instructors via e-mail, Web-based discussion pages, and telephone calls. Students interested in Distance Learning should contact the Office of Distance Learning (ODL). For more information contact (877) FLSTATE or visit the web at https://distance.fsu.edu.

It provides a systems view of computing, emphasizing the interdependence of design, object orientation, and distributed systems and networks, from basic software through systems design. This major develops core competencies in programming, database structure, computer organization, and operating systems. It allows opportunities to study a range of other aspects of computer and information science, such as information security, data communication/ networks, computer and network systems administration, theoretical computer science, and software engineering. Every student can expect to become proficient at programming in C, C++, and Assembly Language. Additionally, students may be exposed to other languages such as Java, C#, Ada, Lisp, Scheme, Perl, and HTML. This major is available on campus or through Distance Learning.\nThe coursework required for this major includes a collateral interdisciplinary minor. It is ABET/CAC accredited and is intended to be sufficient for entry to a graduate program in computer science.    \nNote to prospective transfer students. Prospective transfer students should contact as-admissions@fsu.edu (Arts & Sciences Admissions) with specific questions about admission and mapping requirements.  \nInternet Supported Distance Learning\nThe programs available through internet-supported distance learning are degree programs that enable students with an Associate in Arts (A.A.) degree from a Florida public institution to earn an FSU bachelor’s degree without moving to Tallahassee. The programs are designed for part time study. Each student receives access to a course Web site and the e-mail addresses of everyone associated with the class. A unique feature of the distance learning programs is the support FSU provides through an assigned Mentor. Mentors serve as learning guides, helping to facilitate each individual student’s success. Students interact with each other, their Mentors, and their instructors via e-mail, Web-based discussion pages, and telephone calls. Students interested in Distance Learning should contact the Office of Distance Learning (ODL). For more information contact (877) FLSTATE or visit the web at https://distance.fsu.edu  .

The program will pay for tuition for the first two Education/Teaching prerequisite courses. Part time positions with scientists, mathematicians and local schools are available. For more information, see our web site, http://fsu-teach.fsu.edu/ . \nThis is a double-major only program. FSU-Teach majors are first admitted into their primary, discipline-specific major and must meet the statewide common program prerequisites for that major, in this case, the Bachelor of Arts Computer Science degree program. Later, students apply for admission into a secondary major within the College of Education called Secondary STEM Teaching (STEMTEACH). Upon graduation, students are awarded the B.A. degree with majors in FSU-Teach/Computer Science - Math and STEM Teaching.\nNote to prospective transfer students: Prospective transfer students should contact as-admissions@fsu.edu (Arts & Sciences Admissions) with specific questions about admission and mapping requirements.  Prerequisite Coursework                                                                 Students must complete the following prerequisites required for admission in preparation for the upper division major.

The milestones listed to the right of each term are designed to keep you on course to graduate in four years. The Sample Schedule serves as a general guideline to help you build a full schedule each term. The General Education and Elective courses must be selected to satisfy all area and multicultural requirements unless your program meets these requirements with major courses. Milestones are courses and special requirements necessary for timely progress to complete a major. Missing milestones will result in one of two types of map registration stops. The first level (Degree Map Off-track) is placed following grade posting if the student has missed a milestone (course and/or GPA) for the first time in the major. If a student is in non-compliance with milestones for two (2) consecutive semesters (excluding summers), a Major Change Required stop is placed on the student's registration.\nThe Computer Science BA program is designed to prepare students for employment in the computer programming field. Though less math/science oriented than the Bachelors of Science major, the CS/BA major provides a broad background in programming skills, database structure, and computer organization. A student can expect to become proficient at programming in C, C++, and Assembly Language and will have the opportunity to learn other languages as Java, C#, and HTML. As a BA program, participants will need complete 9 hours of humanities/history beyond General Education requirements. \nThis program is limited access. Students must earn a 2.65 GPA to be accepted into the program and must then maintain a minimum GPA of 2.50 to remain in good standing.\n Mapping Coordinator: Shellie Camp  Email: scamp@fsu.edu Sample Schedule Term 1 hrs ENC1101 Freshman Composition3MAC1105 College Algebra3GE Core Social Science3GE History3Elective3Milestones 1Complete ENC1101 ( ≥ C minus )Complete 1st GE Mathematics ( ≥ C minus )Term 2 hrs ENC2135 Research, Genre, and Context 3MAC1140 Pre-Calculus Algebra 3GE Core Natural Science with Lab4GE Core Humanities/Cultural Practice3Milestones 2Complete ENC2135 ( ≥ C minus )Complete MAC 1140 ( ≥ C minus )Minimum Overall GPA ≥ 2.50Term 3 hrs COP3363 Introduction to C++ for majors or COP3014 Programming I3MAC1114 Analytic Trigonometry3GE Social Science3GE Natural Science3COP3353 Introduction to UNIX (if COP3014 is taken instead of COP 3363)1Minor course3Milestones 3Complete MAC 1114 ( ≥ C minus )Term 4 hrs MAC2311 Calculus with Analytic Geometry I4MAD2104 Discrete Mathematics 3CDA3100 Computer Organization I3COP 3330 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Genetic Programming I3Oral Competency1-3Milestones 4Complete MAC 2311 ( ≥ C minus )Minimum Overall GPA ≥ 2.65Summer hrs GE Humanities/Cultural Practice3Term 5 hrs COP4530 Data Structures, Algorithms and Generic Programming II3Foreign Language I4CS Elective3CS Elective3Milestones 5Complete COP3363 or COP 3014 ( ≥ C minus )Recommend beginning Foreign Language requirementMinimum Overall GPA ≥ 2.50 after formally admittedCivic Literacy requirementTerm 6 hrs COP 4521 Secure Parallel & Distr.

The milestones listed to the right of each term are designed to keep you on course to graduate in four years. The Sample Schedule serves as a general guideline to help you build a full schedule each term. The General Education and Elective courses must be selected to satisfy all area and multicultural requirements unless your program meets these requirements with major courses. Milestones are courses and special requirements necessary for timely progress to complete a major. Missing milestones will result in one of two types of map registration stops. The first level (Degree Map Off-track) is placed following grade posting if the student has missed a milestone (course and/or GPA) for the first time in the major. If a student is in non-compliance with milestones for two (2) consecutive semesters (excluding summers), a Major Change Required stop is placed on the student's registration.\nThe interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in Cyber Criminology will teach students how to use computers to facilitate the study of crime and will study how crimes are accomplished through the use of computers. Students must earn a “C” or better in CCJ2020,  CCJ3011 and CCJ4700 and a C minus or better in all other courses that count toward the major.\nNote: Major code determines graduation requirements and the college within which the student graduates.

          "context": "University, College & Department Rules | Computer Science\n\nUniversity, College & Department Rules\nUniversity & College Rules\nPlease see the  FSU Graduate Bulletin  (hard copy or on-line) for more details. The following are rules that apply from the college &/or university:\nStudents in the thesis master’s program or PhD program must register for thesis/dissertation credits each term in which a substantial amount of work is being done on the the thesis/dissertation, even if the minimum of six (6) semester hours of thesis, or 24 semester hours of dissertation, has already been met. Students who have completed the required course work and who continue to use campus facilities and/or receive faculty supervision but who have not made a final thesis/dissertation submission shall include in the required full-time load two (2) hours of thesis/dissertation. Students who have left the campus must register for at least two (2) semester hours of thesis or dissertation credit per term as long as they are receiving faculty supervision.\nStudents must register for at least one (2) semester hours of thesis or dissertation credit in the final term in which a degree is granted even if ALL the requirements for the degree have been completed in previous semesters. This is to cover the costs of manuscript clearance and final degree clearance. Any work with the major professor, committee members or use of university facilities would require registration for two (2) hours of thesis or dissertation.\nTwelve (12) semester hours per semester constitutes a full-time load for graduate students and fellowship holders in the university. However, nine (9) semester hours is considered a full-time load in the Computer Science department for international students and students with an assistantship. International students must obtain the corresponding form from International Studies to be signed to verify this.\nThe maximum number of hours which a graduate student may carry without special permission is fifteen (15). A heavier load requires approval by the dean.\nStudents who have been out of school (i.e. not registered for) two or more consecutive semesters (including summer) must submit an application for readmission to the readmissions section of the Office of the University Registrar. This application must be submitted at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the term for which readmission is desired.\nInternational students are required to be full-time students fall and spring semesters but not during summer unless summer is the first semester for which they are on campus.\nThe major professor of a doctoral student in candidacy must submit a PhD progress report each year. This can be done via the department by completing this on-line document and submitting it to the CS Director of Graduate Studies. This is completed in January of each year.\nOnce admitted to candidacy, a “Doctoral Supervisory Committee” form and a “Admission to Candidacy” form must be completed and filed with the department Graduate Coordinator. Such forms are available from the Graduate Coordinator or Director of Graduate Studies.\nA doctoral student must be admitted to candidacy at least six (6) months prior to the granting of the degree.\nThe Office of Graduate Studies requires notification of thesis/dissertation defense two weeks prior to the defense. It further requires that a doctoral student submit a completed copy of the dissertation to the doctoral committee at least four (4) weeks prior to the defense. See GradSpace on Canvas for deadlines.\nAn electronic version of a completed thesis or dissertation must be submitted to the university.\nDuring the first two weeks of the term in which a candidate expects to receive a degree, application should be made for a diploma at the office of the University Registrar. If a candidate previously filed for a diploma but did not receive the degree, the application must be repeated.\nAdditional Department Rules\nThe department extends the University policy about thesis/dissertation hours to include students who are working on a master’s project. Thus, a student who is using University resources or receiving faculty supervision is required to register for at least two (2) hours of project even if the course requirements are complete.\nEach graduate student is required to meet with his or her advisor at least once per semester. The department advising form is to be completed at each such meeting and should be returned to the Graduate Coordinator in 203 Love. The forms will remain in the student’s file until graduation and will be used as part of the graduation check. Advisors and students are advised to keep copies for their records.\nA graduate student is automatically dropped from the graduate program after three or more U’s in any graduate course.\nThe department has a guideline that a student will only receive a S (satisfactory) for a CGS5xxx course for an undergraduate prerequisite when the student achieves a B- or better in the equivalent undergraduate course.\nMany fellowships have load requirements that are higher than our departmental requirements. In such cases, the fellowship rules supersede those of the department.\nIt is the responsibility of the major professor of the student doing a project, thesis, or dissertation to submit to the director of graduate studies the names of the major professor and committee members as soon as such committee has been formed. This is necessary before signing up for project, thesis, or dissertation hours.\nMasters students doing the thesis or project option are usually restricted from taking Directed Independent Study courses CIS 5900 and CIS 6900. Rather, such students should take thesis or project hours, respectively.\nA student defending a project, thesis, dissertation or area paper is required to inform the graduate coordinator of the title and date, time and location of the defense at least two (2) weeks prior to the defense.\nIt is not required by the department that the chair of Computer Science sign the signature page of the thesis or dissertation.\nUpon completion of a thesis, project or dissertation, a student must submit an electronic copy of such to the CS department webmaster. Additionally, theses and dissertations must be electronically submitted to the university.\nGraduate studies should be engaged as a full-time endeavor. Students who are supported on a qualifying assistantship are expected to be fully engaged with their studies. Additional employment or activity, especially outside the Program is discouraged to ensure timely completion of one’s degree. Requests for additional or outside, employment or activity will be evaluated for conflicts of interest in accordance with the CBA.\nA PhD CS student cannot be admitted to the MS degree program if they already have a MS in Computer Science or MS in Computer Engineering from another institution. Note that a student must be admitted to the MS program before they can obtain an MS degree.\nPriority for continued departmental support will be given to students who are in good academic standing and are making timely progress towards completion of their degree. A graduate student who has completed all of the requirements for the degree can take additional courses, but will not be eligible for departmental support. Lower priority for support may be given to: (1) MS students who have been in the MS program for 2 full years; (2) PhD students with an MS from another institution who have (a) not passed the qualifying exam after 2 years, (b) not passed the qualifying and preliminary exams after 3 years, and (c) not completed the degree after 5 years; (3) PhD students starting with the BS or completed the MS at FSU who have (a) not passed the qualifying exam after 3 years, (b) not passed the qualifying and preliminary exams after 4 years, and (c) not completed the degree after 6 years.\nALL graduate students must complete an Exit Survey before graduation.\nThe minimum satisfactory progress of a CS PhD student is given at the following link:\nPhD Progress Milestones\n",

The technical depth should be appropriate for the capstone of a graduate degree. In particular, it should require study of one or more areas of computer science beyond what is covered by the required graduate and undergraduate courses.\nThe software may be an end product or be incidental to a piece of experimental research (e.g. a simulator, or implementation of an algorithm for performance testing). The originality need not be fundamental. Creativity at a fundamental level, such as in the design of algorithms and data structures, or in the concept of the application, is desirable but not required. It is acceptable to produce “yet another” implementation of a type of software that has been done before. However, in the latter case it is essential that the student first do a study of prior work and document that study with references and analysis, showing how the new implementation incorporates lessons learned from prior practice.\nThe project document shall always include a description of the project adequate to inform the committee members of the motivation, objectives, scope, methods, and results. It shall ordinarily cover the full software development cycle, including requirements analysis, software design, test design, validation testing, and performance analysis. This project description shall have the form of a technical report. If the software is an end product, the project document shall also include user and maintenance documentation. The latter two shall ordinarily be separate from the project description, though they may be presented as appendices.\nThe work submitted for the master’s project, including both the code and the document, is required to be the individual work of the student. The student is allowed and encouraged to solicit review and comment, including editorial suggestions, especially from the major professor and supervisory committee members. However, the student and advisor should keep in mind that by awarding a master’s degree in computer science the department is certifying that the student has mastered technical English writing to a level that is acceptable for a professional.\nIf the master’s project software is part of a larger software development or research project, it may make use of other software components that were not written by the student, but such other components shall be clearly identified and separated from the contributions of the student. Further, if the master’s project is part of a larger project, the organization of the larger project must allow the master’s student a high degree of autonomy and individual responsibility for a well defined and clearly partitioned segment of the project, from the inception to completion of the segment.\nThe application of the above criteria to the project is up to the individual student’s supervisory committee. The committee shall be formed by the start of the project, and registered with the Director of Graduate Studies. All committee members shall be given an early opportunity to review the scope and technical approach of the project, before work has progressed too far to make whatever modifications may be needed to obtain their approval.\nThe project defense is primarily a test of the student’s oral communication skills.\nWhen scheduling the defense, the student shall allow at least ten days to two weeks for review of the final paper by the committee after it has been approved by the major professor. It is the responsibility of the student to schedule the defense and reserve the room and the PC cart through the Graduate Coordinator.\nOnce the project has been defended and all modifications suggested by the major professor and committee have been made, an electronic version must be submitted to the webmaster. Appropriate copyright notices and authorizations should be given to allow the department to distribute the document. The first page of the report should have the student author’s name, the title, and the names of the major professor and committee members.\n",

This document is intended as a guide to the portfolio component of these requirements. Adhering to these guidelines is a requirement for continuing in the doctoral program.\nPortfolio Requirement\nEvery Computer Science doctoral student is required to assemble and submit a portfolio for review no later than the date specified under Portfolio Calendar below.\nPortfolios are reviewed on a regular basis (generally once a year, during the Spring term) by the Portfolio Evaluation Committee (PEC), a faculty committee appointed by the department chair. Feedback to the student on portfolio contents and on progress towards admission to candidacy is provided as a result of these reviews.\nNew portfolios should be submitted to the student’s academic advisor for preliminary review. The advisor may suggest that the student make modifications. Students should print the cover page form and include the form with the Portfolio for submission to the academic advisor for review. When the advisor is satisfied, the advisor will sign the cover page form and transmit the portfolio on to the PEC.\nAdmission to candidacy for the PhD degree consists of two milestones:\nCIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam\nCIS 8964 Doctoral Preliminary Exam (Area Exam)\nA grade of “P” must be earned in both of these. Normally the Doctoral Qualifying Exam would precede, or at least occur in the same semester as, the Area Exam. See below under Portfolio Review and Qualifying Exam for the procedure to follow.\nPortfolio Calendar\nDuring the first semester in the program, the student should assemble a portfolio and submit it to the department office through the student’s academic advisor. This initial portfolio should be submitted as soon as possible, but in no case later than the end of the first semester. (It is understood that the portfolio will not be complete at this point.)\nEvery Fall and Spring semester prior to the student’s admission to candidacy, the student is required to maintain the currency of the portfolio by updating it, asking his or her advisor to review it, and obtaining the advisor’s signature on the portfolio cover page form, by the end of the second week of the semester.\nAt least once a year, typically in the Spring, the portfolio will be reviewed by the Portfolio Evaluation Committee. The result of the review will be advisory in nature.\nWhen the student wishes to take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam:\nFor the term in which the student wishes to take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam, the student should enroll in the course CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam. In order for the student to register for the Qualifying Exam the student’s and the student’s major professor must sign a portfolio cover page form indicating that the professor has reviewed the portfolio and considers it complete . The CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam will be scheduled during that semester.\nFull time students entering with a Masters in Computer Science should normally expect to take the Qualifying Exam near the end of their first year.\nFull time students entering directly from a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science should normally expect to take the Qualifying Exam near the end of their second year.\nFor all students, the CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam should normally occur soon after the core course requirements have been met.\nAfter admission to candidacy, the portfolio should not be modified. It will be archived by the department staff. Copies of the progress reports prepared by the student’s major professor should be placed in the student’s regular departmental advisement file.\nPortfolio Content & Organization\nEvery student in the FSU Computer Science doctoral program is required to prepare a three-ring binder containing as much as possible of the information described below. For each major section, please begin the corresponding section in your binder with a tabbed separator labeled so as to identify the section heading. All sections are required to be included.\nSummary Data\nComplete the following table on personal information:\nPersonal Information\nYour Name:\nYour FSUSN:\nDate entered program (semester/year):\nFull or part time student?\nPrincipal source of support:\nGive the names of your dissertation advisor and other committee members. If the committee has not yet been formed, please indicate this with ‘TBD’. Note that advance into candidacy can only be approved when a committee has been appointed.\nDoctoral Committee\nMajor Professor / Advisor\nCommittee Member\nCommittee Member\nCommittee Member\nExternal Committee Member\nComplete the following table on core courses (see the Graduate Bulletin for information on the core course requirements). You must complete four (4) core courses in total: at least one course from each of the three core areas. List these four core courses in the table below. Note that only those core courses you completed with a grade of B or higher will count towards the complete set of four, so only list the core courses with a grade of B or higher:\nCore Graduate Courses and Grades\nCore Area\nCore Course        \nSemester Taken or Planned  \nName of Instructor  \nGrade Received  \nSoftware\nSystems\nTheory\nAny\nIf you are requesting that courses taken at other institutions be counted toward the core, please provide supporting documentation showing the equivalence. In addition, our department’s Director of Graduate Studies or another qualified graduate faculty member has to make an examination and determine that the course is equivalent. Obtain a letter or memo signed by this person and put a copy in the portfolio. In any case, include in your portfolio a copy of the course syllabus, including at least the information about the prerequisites, topics, and textbook or other references used, and copies of whatever graded work (examinations, projects, etc.) you have retained from the course.\nIn general, to be equivalent, a course must be a graduate course, with similar prerequisites, a similar list of topics, and similar performance expectations. For example, a course in operating systems will not be considered equivalent to COP 5611 unless it is a “second semester” course, i.e. one for which there is another operating systems course like COP 4610 as prerequisite. For the theory area, the course grade must be based on the ability to do mathematical proofs. For the software area, the course must involve substantial hands-on software development, with a mature level of documentation and testing.\nComplete the following table on elective courses, including all the graduate courses you have taken (including thesis and DIS courses) that are not in the list of core courses above.\nElective Courses and Grades\nElective Course        \nSemester Taken or Planned  \nName of Instructor  \nGrade Received  \nGPA for elective courses:\nComplete the following table for all area exams you have taken or plan to take. The last row should be the exam you have taken or plan to take for your current degree.\nArea Exams\nExam Coverage Area   \nDate of Exam (semester/year)   \nResult of Exam   \nState whether you have chosen a doctoral research topic and, if known, give a brief description of the proposed research. (one or two sentences)\nCurriculum VitaeThe CV should contain the following information:\nAcademic degrees: List all degrees you have earned to date, including for each degree the date it was conferred, the subject area, and the institution’s name and general location.\nProfessional employment: List any teaching or research assistantships, any fellowships, and any nonacademic jobs providing training or experience in Computer Science or closely related areas. For teaching and research assistantships, indicate level of effort, e.g., whether these were 1/2 time, 1/4 time, etc. appointments.\nHonors and Awards: List any special academic honors, awards, or honor society memberships.\nPublications: List all published writings for which you are the author or a co-author.\nService: Indicate anything you have done which either directly or indirectly benefited the department, university, or the Computer Science profession–e.g., officer of the student ACM chapter, reviewer for professional conference or journal, assistance at any professional conference, help at science fairs, service in local public schools, etc.\nResearch Publications and Writing\nBegin this required section by repeating the publication list cited in your CV.\nPlace a reprint or photocopy of one research publication or technical writing of which you were the primary author or writer, provided that:\nIf the publication has three authors or fewer in total, then state the role you played in this publication, i.e., what was your role in the research and in the writing of the paper? If your writing was edited by a co-author (such as your advisor), then you should clearly indicate this.\nIf all of your publications have four authors or more in total, or if you were not the person primarily responsible for writing the paper, or if you have no publications, then you must contribute a work of a research or technical nature which you personally created. This could be your Masters Thesis, or if you have not written a thesis, then some other research-oriented or technical writing, such as a term paper, or the area survey paper, or a technical report for which you were the primary author.\nSoftware Engineering A person holding the PhD in Computer Science is expected to have the ability to contribute substantially to significant software artifacts. As such, one such artifact is a required component of the doctoral portfolio. Include a copy of ONE such artifact, including design, engineering, and certification reports, software documentation, and actual code.A listing of unidentified uncommented code is not sufficient. The portfolio must include enough external documentation and internal comments for the reviewers to read and evaluate the scope and quality of the software. Some indication must be included of how the quality of the software was tested. If the software is something submitted for grade in a course, you should include the instructor’s statement of the assignment as external documentation, but that is not sufficient; the code must at least include internal comments. Similarly, for a course assignment you may provide the grade you received, and any comments the instructor made, as part of the “certification report”, but you also should explain how you tested it.For large projects, only indicative samples of the actual code need be included, but the full code should be available either on-line or as a separate document. If lengthy, these items may be submitted in a separate binder. If you include a CD containing materials, please include printed copy of at least some overview material, with pointers to the CD for the rest.If any of the software or documentation components are the work of more than one author, you must indicate what parts of these components you contributed to and estimate the percent of your personal contribution to each part. Moreover, it is best that you also include some examples of your individual work.\nDissertation Research Write a 1-2 page abstract describing your intended area of dissertation research. Include indications of progress you have made.\nSupport List all employment you have had while a graduate student in the department along with the begin/end dates of that employment. Include TA/RA positions, other work within FSU, as well as outside employment. We are interested in some detail, for example, if you are research assistant, describe the position, work requirements (in terms of both effort and outcome), and who the employer/supervisor is. This information is relevant both for the extent to which your activities support your educational objectives and the extent to which they may occupy your time in activities not related to your degree program.For each RA and TA position you have held at FSU, include here photocopies of your semesterly evaluation of performance in those positions.List all fellowship support you have while a student in our program. List the granting agency, the academic and ancillary requirements, and the amount of funding for each fellowship.\nLectures All candidates for doctoral degrees in the department are required to participate in teaching activities at some time during their graduate careers, which will allow them to make an informed decision regarding whether or not they may wish to pursue a career in academia. Therefore, every candidate is required to either teach a course or serve as a recitation instructor for a course before they graduate. This experience can be part of their TA duties or can be obtained at another university prior to coming to FSU. In this section include supportive material that demonstrates lecture preparation and presentation material. Alternatively, include recitation presentation material in case you were assigned recitation responsibilities. This requirement can be waived by the Department chair in special circumstances only. When waived by the Chair, please include a copy of the memo.\nDocumentation Supportive documentation should include:\nPrevious Portfolio Reviews (when applicable)As discussed above, doctoral student portfolios will be reviewed regularly by the Portfolio Review Committee, and each student will be sent a letter indicating the committee’s evaluation of the student’s progress toward the degree. Photocopies of all such letters to date are to appear in this section of the portfolio.\nTranscripts To the extent these are available, include copies of your transcripts from prior institutions, i.e., universities or colleges you attended prior to your beginning as a graduate student in Computer Science at FSU. If you submitted transcripts with your application to our graduate program, the departmental staff can make photocopies of these for you from your application file, if you so request.\nGRE and TOEFL Score Reports (when available)In this section, place photocopies of the official reporting forms of your GRE and TOEFL scores reported in section 1 above. When you opt to omit it, the department will retrieve this information electronically.\nArea Exam Reports In this section place photocopies of the result reports from all area exams you have taken.\nPortfolio Review and Qualifying Exam\nThe PhD Portfolio is intended to provide the department with a complete view of the student’s accomplishments and abilities that relate to likelihood of success as a PhD professional. The portfolio is reviewed regularly by the Portfolio Evaluation Committee to determine whether the student is making suitable progress towards the degree, and must be completed with a list of the satisfactory grades (B or higher) for the four core graduate courses when the student takes the Doctoral Qualifying Exam. Based on the completion of the portfolio, a student can enroll in CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam. A passing grade “P” for the CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam is one of the two required components of admission to candidacy.\nThe student should be enrolled in CIS 8962 Doctoral Qualifying Exam when he or she has completed the four core graduate courses, completed the portfolio, and both the student and major professor agree that the student is ready to take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam. ( Doctoral Qualifying Exams may be scheduled for Fall or Spring semester, but not Summer semester.) The Portfolio Evaluation Committee will schedule and conduct the Doctoral Qualifying Exam during the semester. The exam will be oral and will cover the four core graduate courses taken by the student. The student will be tested on the four core graduate course topics. The student is strongly advised to study the core course topics well in advance in preparation for the Doctoral Qualifying Exam.\nA student cannot take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam if he or she has not completed the four core graduate courses. However, there is one exception to this rule. A student who has received satisfactory grades with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher for all but one of the core courses can take the Qualifying Exam in the Spring term in which the last core course is being taken, assuming that the Qualifying Exams take place after spring break. In that case, the student is expected to be able to answer questions about all of the four core courses, including the core course currently being taken. If the student passes the oral, the exam is not recorded as passed until after the end of the term, and the chair of the Portfolio Evaluation Committee has verified that the remaining core course has been passed with an acceptable grade.\nIn evaluating the portfolio for the Doctoral Qualifying Exam, no single aspect of the portfolio is taken as a determining factor, but rather an attempt is made to consider all strengths and weaknesses and to determine whether, overall, the student may reasonably be expected to succeed and become a credit to the department. Components of such success generally are as follows:\nGeneral competency in Computer Science.In order to demonstrate adequate mastery of the breadth of Computer Science, we ordinarily expect a successful candidate to maintain a GPA of at least 3.5 in the core courses required for the degree. A GPA below 3.5 for the core courses is sufficient cause to deny permission to take the Qualifying Exam, unless convincing justifications are presented to the committee for consideration. Candidates may refer to the grading scale for PhD students in graduate courses that has been adopted by the department. The Portfolio Evaluation Committee may make exceptions to this GPA rule if it finds compelling evidence of exceptional strength in research. For example, a slightly lower GPA might be offset by published papers in reputable journals or conference proceedings. Note that the four core courses you took must be completed with a B or higher grade. If a student receives an A in a CS graduate core course at FSU, then the student is exempt from taking the exam. If you completed a core course with an unsatisfactory grade of B- or lower, do not list this course as a core course but list the course as an elective. Then sign up for another core course in that same core area to ensure you have taken four core courses, with at least one course from each core area.The Doctoral Qualifying Exam tests the general knowledge of the candidate in areas covered by the four core graduate courses.\nResearch Aptitude.Research is a critical component of the PhD degree process and is a fundamental part of most professional positions that require a PhD as credentials. The department would like to admit to candidacy individuals who have demonstrated the ability, or aptitude, for research in the field.\nSoftware Skills.The creation of computer software is a fundamental part of computer science, and the department generally expects that its graduates possess the skills and training necessary to contribute to such endeavors.\nCommunication Skills.The department wishes to see that the student has a capacity to express his or her thoughts in publication-quality English. Thus there is a requirement that the Portfolio contain some writing sample that demonstrates written communication skills, and the Doctoral Qualifying Exam serves to evaluate spoken communication skills. The writing requirement may be met by a professional publication, masters thesis, a masters degree project report, or any other writing that the student may have produced as part of his or her course work. Note that an ability to present one’s ideas in written English is considered as separate from an ability to conduct research, and that both abilities are deemed necessary.The department also wishes to see that the student is capable of responding extemporaneously to oral questions, as a researcher is required to do when presenting a paper at a conference and a professor is required to do when teaching. The Doctoral Qualifying Exam is a test of these oral communication skills. The student will be expected to be able to understand the questions presented by the examiners, and to answer them on the spot.\nPhD Grading Scale\nThe Florida State University Department of Computer Science has adopted a grade interpretation scale for PhD students and any other students who take graduate courses in the department and may wish at some future time to enter the PhD program. Effective Fall 2002, grades in graduate courses taught by Computer Science Department faculty will use this grade interpretation scale. The scale is given by the following table.\nCourse Grade\nCS Department Interpretation\nA\nPerformance met or exceeded expectations for PhD students\nA-\nPerformance met expectations for PhD students\nB+\nPerformance was marginally below expectations for PhD students\nB\nPerformance was significantly below expectations for PhD students\nB-\nPerformance was unsatisfactory for PhD students\nC+ or below\nPerformance was unsatisfactory for graduate work\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I substitute another course for one of the four required core courses? How about doing it just for the Portfolio Review, if I promise to take the course later?A: No. The Qualifying Exam is the point at which the Department checks for completion of the required core courses and the quality of work in those courses. Until you take the course we have no way to tell how well you will have done in the course.Of course, with adequate justification, departments at FSU are permitted to approve course substitutions in degree requirements. The PEC will only consider a substitution if the Portfolio contains a copy of a letter approving a course substitution for the degree requirements, signed by Director of Graduate Studies and the Department Chair.\nQ: I received a B- for a core course. Should I take another core course and have that one count towards to four core courses?A: Yes, you can choose another core course as long as you take at least three core courses to cover all three core areas as part of the total of four core courses you want to count towards the Qualifying Exam.\nQ: What kind of oral questions can I expect at the Qualifying Exam?A: That will be up to the individual members of the PEC. You should expect questions on the four areas: (a) general competency in CS; (b) research aptitude; (c) software skills; (d) communication skills. If the portfolio itself is strong, all or most of the questions are likely to be on (a).\nIn area (a) the intent of the questions will be to gauge your understanding and retention of material normally covered in the four core courses and their undergraduate prerequisites. For example, if you have taken Automata and Formal Languages as part of your core requirement, you should not be take by surprise if you are asked to explain what is a finite state machine, what is the difference between a deterministic and a non deterministic finite state machine, what it means for a gramar to be ambiguous, how that compares to a language being inherently ambiguous, etc..Be sure to have your major professor, and possibly others, help you prepare for such questions. Minimal preparation would include reviewing your notes from the core courses, and then answering some oral questions from each of the areas they cover.A big part of preparing for the exam is learning to be comfortable listening to questions, making sure you understand (by asking for clarification if necessary), and then expressing yourself clearly. You will have an easel and pen to write on. Plan to use it appropriately, to help with your answer. A “mock” oral examination is a good way to practice.Students who have not taken the core courses recently, or who have transferred credit for a core course from another institution, should expect to be asked more questions on the core courses, to verify that the knowledge has not become stale, and that the material learned is similar in scope and depth to what is covered in the corresponding course here at FSU. Similarly, if you took the course at FSU but your grade was not A or A-, you may expect more questions on that course.\nIn area (b) you might expect questions concerning your research experience, your contributions to any research papers in your portfolio, your research plans, and the membership of your supervisory committee.\nIn area (c) you might expect questions on what software you wrote, and the examples of software you included in your portfolio.\nIn area (d) you might expect questions on the technical writing samples you included in your portfolio, but mainly the committee will be judging your communication skills by the manner in which you answer the questions about (a). That is: Can you understand the question? Can you ask appropriate questions for clarification? Can you give a clear answer? How well you do these things in the exam will be viewed as indication of your ability to function in a classroom, and as a speaker at a research conference.\nThese are just examples, not intended to limit the options of individual committee members.\nAlong with the questions, if the questions do not take up all of the available time, you can expect some encouraging words about the strong points of your portfolio, and some constructive advice as to how to proceed.\nQ: Can I take the Qualifying Exam during the summer term?A: No, or at least you should not count on it. Very few of the faculty are available during the summer as they tend to leave town to attend conference meetings. If there happen to be enough members of the PEC in town, an exam may be held in exceptional cases.\nQ: Can I do my Area Examination before my Qualifying Exam?A: Not officially. The course number for the Area Examination is listed as the Ph.D. Preliminary Examination, and the FSU Graduate Bulletin says that a student is admitted to Ph.D. candidacy by passing the Preliminary Examination. Our department’s faculty has set up the admission to candidacy as a two-step process. The necessary first step is the Qualifying Exam. In a few cases, for scheduling reasons, a student may go through the Area Examination process, but a passing grade for the Area Examination cannot be turned in until the student has completed the Qualifying Exam. If the are done the same term, this can work out. Students and advisors should take care about this. If, by some oversight, a passing grade for the Area Examination were to be turned in before the student passes the Qualifying Exam, the Department would need to revoke the passing grade on the Area Examination until the Qualifying Exam is passed.\nQ: What if I took courses at another institution, that I want to count toward my core requirement?A: First, you should have obtained some clearance for transfer credit when you were admitted, and you should put a copy of a letter or memo to this effect in your portfolio. Second, you should include in your portfolio the name of the textbook you used in the course, a copy of the course syllabus, and examples of graded exams and projects form the course. This will enable the PEC to gauge whether the course seems equivalent, and to know what sort of questions to ask during your oral examination on that area.\nQ: When will I know whether I passed?A: The PEC will probably wait to tell anyone until all of the students taking the Qualifying Exam that term have completed the exam.\nQ: Can I talk with other students about the exam, after I take it?A: You are asked not to discuss questions you were asked on the oral exam with anyone, until you are told the result of the exam. This allows us to be fairer to all students. For example, suppose you have trouble on a question. It may be that all students have trouble with that question, and the committee decides to disregard it. However, if you tell another student who is due to take the exam later, and the other student then looks up the answer and so answers better than you did, the committee may conclude that the question was not hard, and that you have no excuse for answering poorly.\nQ: Do I need to form my entire Ph.D. supervisory committee before I take the Qualifying Exam?A: This is not a requirement, but if you do not yet have your supervisory committee formed you need to do it right away, because you need the full supervisory committee before you can move on to the next step, which is the Area Examination.\nQ: Do I need to choose my research area before I take the Qualifying Exam?A: This is not a requirement, but if you do not yet have your area chosen you need to do it right away, since you can’t prepare for the CIS 8964 Preliminary Exam until you have chosen an area.\n",

          "context": "PhD Degree Information | Computer Science\n\nPhD Degree Information\nThe number of hours for the graduate degree as described in this web page will be effective in Summer 2018.\nGraduate Student Handbook – Doctoral Degree\nThe Doctor of Philosophy is regarded as a research degree and is awarded on the basis of accomplishment in a recognized specialty in computer science. Such accomplishment should include scholarly mastery of the field, significant contributions to new knowledge in the field, and written and oral communication skills appropriate for the field.\nThe requirements for the Ph.D. include the following: passing CIS 8962, the qualifying examination (portfolio defense), and CIS 8964, preliminary examination (area exam); satisfaction of the course requirements; successfully defending a dissertation prospectus, and successfully defending a dissertation. All candidates for doctoral degrees in the department are required to participate in teaching activities at some time during their graduate careers unless waived by the department chair. Additionally, each doctoral student must complete at least one oral research presentation which is critiqued by at least one faculty member. This can be at the departmental research conference or any discipline-related conference. Each PhD has a Publication Requirement and as such that student is required to be the primary (e.g., first) author for at least one accepted or published regular paper (six or more pages) in a conference or journal that is ranked B or higher by the Computing Research and Education Association (CORE) [http://www.core.edu.au].\nCourse Requirements\nThe doctoral student must complete the undergraduate pre-requisites before graduating. The doctoral student should have completed four core courses (18 hours), with at least one course in each of the three areas Software, Systems, and Theory (the PhD core course requirement). These core courses are defined in the  FSU Master’s degree requirements. Equivalent courses taken at other institutions must be approved by the Portfolio Evaluation Committee (PEC).\nStudents entering the program after earning a Master’s degree in Computer Science or related area must take at least four additional courses (12 hours) beyond those taken for the MS degree, at the 5000 or 6000 level, as advised by the student’s major professor and supervisory committee. These courses must be taken at FSU and a maximum of 2 courses (6 hours) may come from outside of the department. Core courses can also be used to meet this “4 additional course” requirement, provided they are taken at FSU and were not completed as part of an MS program. Supervised Teaching, Supervised Research, DIS and courses with prefix CGS do not count towards this requirement.\nStudents entering the program after earning a bachelor’s degree in computer science or related area, must take at least nine courses (27 hours) at the 5000 or 6000 level, as advised by the student’s major professor and supervisory committee. Four of these courses (12 hours) must meet the PhD core course requirement. The remaining five courses (15 hours) must be taken at FSU and cannot be part of an MS degree program outside of the FSU Computer Science Department. A maximum of two courses (6 hours) may come from outside of the Computer Science Department. Supervised teaching, supervised research, DIS, and courses with prefix CGS do not count towards this requirement.\nIf a PhD student takes CIS5920 Colloquium three times and gets an S each time, then this may substitute for one 3 hour course.\nThe student’s PhD committee can require the student to take more than the aforementioned number of courses. The student must receive a grade of “B-” or better on all graduate courses taken to satisfy the minimum course requirements of the degree. Once these minimum requirements are met, however, it is permissible to take any subsequent courses on an “S/U” basis.\nOnce a student has completed twenty-seven (27) semester hours of graduate work or has been awarded the Master’s degree, the student must be enrolled on The Florida State University Tallahassee campus for a minimum of twenty-four (24) graduate semester hours credit within a continuous 12-month period to meet the university residency requirement. The doctoral student must also complete at least twenty-four (24) hours of CIS 6980r Dissertation. A student may enroll in CIS 6980r only after being admitted to candidacy. Once admitted to candidacy, Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two Dissertation hours each semester until completion (of degree) and must graduate with the doctoral degree within five years of being admitted to doctoral candidacy.\nMajor Professor and Supervisory Committee\nAs early as is feasible in the student’s program, the student should identify an area for dissertation research and secure an informal agreement with a faculty member to serve as the student’s major professor. This agreement should include an understanding of the area and timeline of the dissertation research. This agreement is then made formal by the Department Chair appointing that faculty member to serve in this capacity. In a similar manner, the student must secure agreements with, and the Chair must approve, the remaining members of the student’s Supervisory Committee: one (1) additional faculty members in the Department; one (1) Representative-at-large who is a member of the graduate faculty in another department. Graduate Studies requires the representative-at-large to ensure “that University policies are followed, and that decisions made by the supervisory committee reflect the collective judgment of the committee. Therefore, the graduate faculty representative must be someone who is free of conflicts of interest with other members of the committee.” If there are any questions as to the appropriateness of a particular faculty member to serve in this role, the Dean of Graduate Studies should be contacted. In addition, the Chair will appoint a member to serve as a Department Representative. All members must hold doctoral directive status. The supervisory committee is responsible for approving an individual program of study, including any additional course requirements, and verifying that the student satisfies the following departmental requirements. The area examination, prospectus, and dissertation defenses must be unanimously approved by the major professor and supervisory committee.\nStudent Portfolio Defense (CIS 8962, Qualifying Exam)\nAll students admitted to the program, but not yet admitted to candidacy, are required to compile and keep current a portfolio containing information relevant to the student’s progress in the program. Required contents of the portfolio, submission dates, and guidelines for preparing the portfolio are published by the Department of Computer Science at  PhD Portfolio. When all components of the portfolio are complete, the student should register for the portfolio defense (CIS 8962).\nThe portfolio of any student not yet in candidacy is reviewed annually by the departmental Portfolio Evaluation Committee (PEC). This committee consists of a core that is appointed by the Department Chair and normally meets in the spring. Feedback to the student on the contents of the portfolio and on progress towards admission to candidacy is provided after each review.\nThe final review occurs in conjunction with the defense of the portfolio. Thus, when a student and his or her major professor agree the portfolio is complete, the student should register for the Doctoral Qualifying Exam, CIS 8962 (0) for the next semester. Students will be required to pass an oral examination over the material in four core courses, with at least one course in each of the three areas Software, Systems, and Theory (the PhD core course requirement). If a student has taken a core course at FSU and has received a grade of an A-, then the student is exempt from having to take an oral examination in that course.\nIf the student is not successful on the first sitting of the Qualifying Exam, a grade of “I” will be assigned. If the second sitting of the exam is also unsuccessful, a grade of “F” is assigned. A student can take the Qualifying Exam at most twice. A student either passes or fails; there is no conditional pass.\nIf the student is successful, he or she should register for CIS 6900 DIS hours to maintain enrollment status until the completion of the Area Examination (CIS 8964, Preliminary Exam). Prior to this benchmark, PhD’s should use CIS 5900 DIS hours to reflect research efforts as they complete the coursework and ready themselves for the Qualifying Exam (CIS 8962).\nArea Examination (CIS 8964, Preliminary Exam)\nThe area examination (CIS 8964) covers the student’s intended area of research. It has both written and oral parts. Both parts of the examination are conducted by the student’s supervisory committee, which may delegate the responsibility to a larger area committee. It is strongly recommended that the student write an area survey paper as part of this exam. The oral part is open to all department faculty having doctoral status who elect to participate. The oral part of the examination is held in an open forum which other students are invited to attend and is followed by a closed session if the committee so desires. Students who do not pass the area exam may be advised to retake it at a later time. A student who changes to a new research area after having previously passed this exam will be required to stand for a further exam over the new area. A student can fail the area exam at most once.\nA PhD CS student can be exempt from writing the document for the area exam if the student was the primary author on an accepted or published paper in the general intended research area and the student’s PhD committee deems the paper and the publication venue to be acceptable.  However, an oral examination for the area exam is still required.  The student’s PhD committee may allow the student to present the accepted or published paper in place of the normal presentation of the research area, but the PhD committee can still ask the student questions about the intended area of research.\nNormal expectations are that the portfolio defense occurs prior to taking the area exam, or at least in the same semester as the area exam. Within two semesters (including summer) of passing the QE, a doctoral student should have taken the area exam.\nAdmission to Candidacy\nIn order to be advanced to candidacy for the doctoral degree, the student must:\npass CIS 8962, the qualifying examination, which consists of passing the defense of the portfolio, and\npass CIS 8964, the preliminary exam, which consists of passing the area examination.\nSuggested Timeline\nby the end of the first academic year, a doctoral student who entered the program with an MS degree, should have completed the QE and established a doctoral committee\nfor a doctoral student who entered the program without an MS degree, the student should have completed the QE and formed a doctoral committee by the end of the second academic year\nwithin two semesters (including summer) of passing the QE, a doctoral student should have taken the PE (area exam).\nProspectus\nThe student must formally propose the research for the dissertation to his or her Supervisory Committee in the form of a prospectus. The prospectus should consist of much of the background work for the dissertation, including:\nthorough literature review;\nthe theory, preliminary computational results, and/or bases for the feasibility of the research;\na proposal for the research to be completed for the dissertation.\nIn addition, as an appendix to the prospectus, publication plans should be presented. The research proposed should make clear any substantial advances in the state of knowledge in computer science, and the publication plans should be designed to affirm the quality and nature of the research. The publication should be in nationally recognized conferences and journals in the field. The prospectus must be successfully defended before the student’s supervisory committee in an open meeting.\nDissertation\nAfter completing the research proposed in the prospectus, the student must write a dissertation. The dissertation represents the fulfillment of the proposals made in the prospectus. The dissertation document must comply with all current University standards for style. The dissertation must be successfully defended before the student’s committee in an open meeting. The dissertation must be successfully defended within five (5) years of passing the preliminary exam. An electronic version of the dissertation must be submitted to the university as well as the CS webmaster, and CS graduate coordinator.\nScholarly Engagement Requirement\nEach CS doctoral student must be scholarly engaged during their academic studies. A PhD CS student meets the scholarly engagement requirement by giving at least one presentation at an FSU CS graduate student seminar, an FSU CS Department seminar, or at an international conference. It is also recommended that each PhD CS student attends as many department and graduate student colloquia as possible.\nPublication Requirement\nEach PhD student is required to be the primary (e.g., first) author for at least one accepted or published regular paper (six or more pages) in a conference or journal that is ranked B or higher by the Computing Research and Education Association (CORE) [http://www.core.edu.au]; see the here on how to request an exception.\nExamination in Defense of Dissertation\nThe defense of the dissertation will be oral. Responsibility for suggesting the time, designating the place, and presiding at the examination rests with the major professor. It is recommended that students defend no later than the eighth week of classes in the semester of intent to graduate. Students must defend by no later than the Format Approval Deadline in the semester of intent to graduate. Consult the Graduate School Canvas site GradSpace for more information.\nAcademic courtesy requires that the dissertation be submitted to each member of the supervisory committee at least four weeks before the date of the oral examination. The supervisory committee, the chair of the major department, and such other members of the faculty as may be appointed by the academic dean will conduct the examination. All members of the graduate faculty are invited to attend. At least two weeks prior to the date of the examination, the student or major professor will present an announcement of the dissertation title and the date and place of the examination to the Graduate School. Consult the Registration Guide for the deadline dates\nAll committee members and the student must attend the entire defense in real-time, either by being physically present or participating via distance technology. If exceptional emergency circumstances, e.g. medical or other emergency situations, prevent the participation of a committee member then it may be necessary to arrange for an additional appropriately qualified colleague to attend the defense. A minimum of four members with Graduate Faculty Status must participate.\nThe oral examining committee will certify in writing to the academic dean of the major department the results of the examination: passed, failed, or to be re-examined. The report of results following a re-examination must indicate the student either passed or failed. To receive a passing grade, the written dissertation must be in final form or require only minor revisions at the time of the defense. A grade of PASS for the defense of treatise or dissertation requires at least a majority approval of the committee.\nIf the student passes, each member must sign the Manuscript Signature Form to substantiate the results of the defense. It is the responsibility of the major professor to submit this completed form either directly to the Clearance Advisor or to the appropriate college or departmental office for subsequent delivery to the Clearance Advisor in The Graduate School. A written critique of the conduct of the examination in defense of the dissertation should be submitted by the university representative from the graduate faculty to the appropriate academic dean and the Dean of the Graduate School within one week after the date of defense. The degree cannot be awarded until both forms have been received by the Graduate School and the final version of the manuscript has been submitted to and approved by the Clearance Advisor.\n",

Unlike a major, a student does not need to be formally admitted to a minor, nor does the minor appear on the transcript. The Department and the Registrar do not have any forms to fill out or any way to register that a student intends to complete a minor in a particular subject. A student who has fulfilled the requirements for any given minor simply claims the minor when requesting a Graduation Check with their respective College.\nDocumentation\nIt is up to the student’s major Department or College if they require the student to complete a minor, to verify that the student has completed an acceptable minor. This can be checked using the lists below. Because the content of this web page may change in the future, it would be a good idea for a student to print out a copy of this web page at the point the student decides to do a minor, and save the copy for later verification of the minor.\nApproved Tracks\nThe following SCIENCE TRACK is a rigorous set of courses (essentially the beginning of a computer science major) that is approved and recommended for the minor:\nCourse\nPrerequisites\nCOP 3014 (3)  or COP 3363 (3)* \nMAC 1140\nCOP 3353 (1) or  COP 3363 (3)* \nnone\nCOP 3330 (3)\nCOP 3353 (co/prerequisite) and COP 3014\nPlus two of the following:\nCDA 3100 (3)\n COP 3330 (co/pre) and MAD 2104 (co/pre)\nCEN 4020 (3)\n COP 4530 (co/pre)\nCIS 4360 (3)\nCOP 3330\nCNT 4603 (3)\n CGS 3406 or COP 3014\nCOP 3252 (3)\n COP 3330\nCOP 4342 (3)\n COP 3330\nCOP 4530 (3)\n COP 3330 and MAD 2104 and CDA 3100 (co/pre)\nCOP 4710 (3)\n COP 3330 and MAD 2104\nCOP 4610 (3)\n COP 4530, CDA 3100\n*COP 3363 combines COP 3014 and COP 3353; students may satisfy both requirements with this course.

          "context": "Policy on Tutors | Computer Science\n\nPolicy on Tutors\nThis department discourages the use of tutors. Students who have problems in a course should first contact their instructor. A student who needs a modest amount of individual help should get it from the instructor and teaching assistants for the course.\nWhile we cannot prevent a student from hiring a tutor, we will not endorse or recommend anyone as a tutor, nor will we act as intermediary for students attempting to locate a tutor.\nThis policy is based on the following considerations:\nWe want to hear if students are having trouble in a course. If a student has the prerequisites for a course and is putting in the expected level of effort, and if the course is being taught well enough, there should be no need for a tutor. When students hire tutors instead of going to the instructor or department administration to solve their problems it can make it appear to the instructor and the department that everything is going well when in fact it is not. For example: if there is a need to spend more time teaching a particular topic, the instructor needs to find out; if the student is missing necessary background, it may be best for the student to switch to another course; if the instructor is not doing the job well, the department chair should hear about it. In short, if there is a serious problem we want to be informed of it and to solve it. This is the main reason for the policy.\nWe cannot guarantee the competence of a tutor. An incompetent or misinformed tutor could do a student academic harm.\nStudent problems are often very specific to material that is covered in class, or that is related to a programming assignment. Since tutors do not attend the class meetings, they will not be well informed. If a student hires a tutor and the tutor teaches the student something different from what the instructor is teaching, the student will suffer.\nWe have seen cases of tutors helping students do programming assignments. This is a big temptation for the student and the tutor, since it is much quicker and easier to show a person how to solve a specific homework problem or programming assignment than it is to help the student learn the skills needed to solve the problem on his/her own. When this happens it is bad in two ways:\nIt is a violation of the FSU Academic Honor Code.\nThe student’s final grade suffers. Since the learning objectives of the assignment are not accomplished, the student will not have the knowledge and skills to pass the examinations. This can result in a student having even an “A” average on homework and failing the course. (It is common for courses to have a policy that examination grades must be at least passing in order for a student to pass a course, no matter how high the grades on unsupervised work.)\nUsing a tutor in a college course is unfair to other students, in the sense that it gives students with extra money an advantage over students who might work as hard or harder but who have less money to spend.\nNote: The policy of discouraging the use of tutors does not apply to accommodations for disabilities that are approved by the Student Disability Resource Center.\nIf such a student wants to find a tutor, there are usually some upper level undergraduate students and graduate students who are willing to serve as tutors. Notices soliciting and offering tutoring services show up on bulletin boards in the Love Building from time to time.\n",

However, we do believe there will be significant opportunities for BA in CS students who are primarily interested in applications outside the sciences and engineering.

His line of research aims to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of cryptography, giving products of genuine utility that are theoretically justified yet faster than heuristic solutions. For example, he has built a new authenticated encryption scheme AEZ to improve both security and speed of standardized schemes underlying Internet protocols such as HTTPS, IPSec, and WPA2. AEZ is currently a second-round candidate in the standardization competition CAESAR. Dr. Hoang’s research papers earned the Best Honorable Mention at EUROCRYPT 2015 and Best Paper Award at CCS 2015.",

The student must receive a grade of “B-” or better on all graduate courses taken to satisfy the minimum requirements of either graduate degree. Once these minimum requirements are met, however, it is permissible to take any subsequent courses on an S/U basis. Upon joining the department, each graduate student is assigned an advisor by the director of graduate studies. At least once each semester the student is required to meet with the advisor and complete the departmental advising forms. Completion of these forms becomes part of the graduation check. For those students completing a thesis, project or dissertation, a major professor will be selected by the student once a topic for such is chosen. At this point the major professor takes over the advising responsibilities. For those master’s students in the course-based option, the advisor initially assigned continues in the advisement role. Advising forms stay with the advisor (major professor) until the graduation check. All candidates for doctoral degrees in the department are required to participate in teaching activities at some time during their graduate careers unless waived by the department chair.
